audio.]Thank you very much.Good evening, my fellow Americans. I appreciate so very 
much the opportunity to speak with you tonight.Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Governor, friends, distinguished guests, our country has 
been through a long and trying period, with the outcome of the presidential 
election not finalized for longer than any of us could ever imagine.Vice President Gore and I put our hearts and hopes into our campaigns. We both 
gave it our all. We shared similar emotions, so I understand how difficult this 
moment must be for Vice President Gore and his family.He has a distinguished record of service to our country as a congressman, a 
senator and a vice president.This evening I received a gracious call from the vice president. We agreed to 
meet early next week in Washington, and we agreed to do our best to heal our 
country after this hard-fought contest.Tonight I want to thank all the thousands of volunteers and campaign workers who 
worked so hard on my behalf.I also salute the vice president and his supports for waging a spirited 
campaign. And I thank him for a call that I know was difficult to make. Laura 
and I wish the vice president and Senator Lieberman and their families the very 
best.I have a lot to be thankful for tonight. I'm thankful for America and thankful 
that we were able to resolve our electoral differences in a peaceful way.I'm thankful to the American people for the great privilege of being able to 
serve as your next president.I want to thank my wife and our daughters for their love. Laura's active 
involvement as first lady has made Texas a better place, and she will be a 
wonderful first lady of America.I am proud to have Dick Cheney by my side, and America will be proud to have him 
as our next vice president.Tonight, I chose to speak from the chamber of the Texas House of Representatives 
because it has been a home to bipartisan cooperation. Here in a place where 
Democrats have the majority, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to 
do what is right for the people we represent.We've had spirited disagreements. And in the end, we found constructive 
consensus. It is an experience I will always carry with me, an example I will 
always follow.I want to thank my friend, House Speaker Pete Laney, a Democrat, who introduced 
me today. I want to thank the legislators from both political parties with whom 
I've worked.Across the hall in our Texas capitol is the state Senate. And I cannot help but 
think of our mutual friend, the former Democrat lieutenant governor, Bob 
Bullock. His love for Texas and his ability to work in a bipartisan way continue 
to be a model for all of us.The spirit of cooperation I have seen in this hall is what is needed in 
Washington, D.C. It is the challenge of our moment. After a difficult election, 
we must put politics behind us and work together to make the promise of America 
available for every one of our citizens.I'm optimistic that we can change the tone in Washington, D.C.I believe things happen for a reason, and I hope the long wait of the last five 
weeks will heighten a desire to move beyond the bitterness and partisanship of 
the recent past.Our nation must rise above a house divided. Americans share hopes and goals and 
values far more important than any political disagreements.Republicans want the best for our nation, and so do Democrats. Our votes may 
differ, but not our hopes.I know America wants reconciliation and unity. I know Americans want progress. 
And we must seize this moment and deliver.Together, guided by a spirit of common sense, common courtesy and common goals, 
we can unite and inspire the American citizens.Together, we will work to make all our public schools excellent, teaching every 
student of every background and every accent, so that no child is left behind.Together, we will save Social Security and renew its promise of a secure 
retirement for generations to come.Together, we will strengthen Medicare and offer prescription drug coverage to all 
of our seniors.Together, we will give Americans the broad, fair, and fiscally responsible tax 
relief they deserve.Together, we'll have a bipartisan foreign policy true to our values and true to 
our friends, and we will have a military equal to every challenge and superior 
to every adversary.Together, we will address some of society's deepest problems one person at a 
time, by encouraging and empowering the good hearts and good works of the 
American people.This is the essence of compassionate conservatism and it will be a foundation of 
my administration.These priorities are not merely Republican concerns or Democratic concerns; they 
are American responsibilities.During the fall campaign, we differed about the details of these proposals, but 
there was remarkable consensus about the important issues before us: excellent 
schools, retirement and health security, tax relief, a strong military, a more 
civil society.We have discussed our differences. Now it is time to find common ground and 
build consensus to make America a beacon of opportunity in the 21st century.I'm optimistic this can happen. Our future demands it and our history proves it. 
Two hundred years ago, in the election of 1800, America faced another close 
presidential election. A tie in the Electoral College put the outcome into the 
hands of Congress.After six days of voting and 36 ballots, the House of Representatives elected 
Thomas Jefferson the third president of the United States. That election brought 
the first transfer of power from one party to another in our new democracy.Shortly after the election, Jefferson, in a letter titled ""Reconciliation and 
Reform,"" wrote this: ""The steady character of our countrymen is a rock to which 
we may safely moor; unequivocal in principle, reasonable in manner. We should be 
able to hope to do a great deal of good to the cause of freedom and harmony.""Two hundred years have only strengthened the steady character of America. And so 
as we begin the work of healing our nation, tonight I call upon that character: 
respect for each other, respect for our differences, generosity of spirit, and a 
willingness to work hard and work together to solve any problem.I have something else to ask you, to ask every American. I ask for you to pray 
for this great nation. I ask for your prayers for leaders from both parties. I 
thank you for your prayers for me and my family, and I ask you to pray for Vice 
President Gore and his family.I have faith that with God's help we as a nation will move forward together as 
one nation, indivisible. And together we will create an America that is open, 
so every citizen has access to the American dream; an America that is educated, 
so every child has the keys to realize that dream; and an America that is united 
in our diversity and our shared American values that are larger than race or 
party.I was not elected to serve one party, but to serve one nation.The president of the United States is the president of every single American, of 
every race and every background.Whether you voted for me or not, I will do my best to serve your interests and I 
will work to earn your respect.I will be guided by President Jefferson's sense of purpose, to stand for 
principle, to be reasonable in manner, and above all, to do great good for the 
cause of freedom and harmony.The presidency is more than an honor. It is more than an office. It is a charge 
to keep, and I will give it my all.Thank you very much and God bless America",victory victory speechdelivered december require flash audioyour browser support audio pdf authenticity certify text

1,20 January 2001,sh - First Inaugural Addr,"ice Rehnquist, 
			President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, 
			distinguished guests and my fellow citizens:The peaceful transfer 
			of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a 
			simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings.As I begin, I thank 
			President Clinton for his service to our nation.And I thank Vice 
			President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with 
			grace.I am honored and humbled 
			to stand here, where so many of America's leaders have come before 
			me, and so many will follow.We have a place, all of 
			us, in a long story -- a story we continue, but whose end we will not 
			see. It is a story of a new world that became a friend and 
			liberator of the old, a story of a slave-holding society that became 
			a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went into the world 
			to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer.It is the American 
			story -- a story of flawed and fallible people, united across the 
			generations by grand and enduring ideals. The grandest of these 
			ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs, that 
			everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever 
			born. Americans are called to 
			enact this promise in our lives and in our laws. And though our 
			nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow 
			no other course.Through much of the last 
			century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a 
			raging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many 
			nations. Our democratic faith is 
			more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our 
			humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass 
			along. And even after nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to 
			travel.While many of our 
			citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our 
			own country. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing 
			schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth. 
			And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a 
			continent, but not a country. We do not accept this, 
			and we will not allow it. Our unity, our union, is the serious work 
			of leaders and citizens in every generation.And this is my solemn 
			pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and 
			opportunity.I know this is in our 
			reach because we are guided by a Power larger than ourselves who 
			creates us equal in His image.And we are confident in 
			principles that unite and lead us onward. America has never been 
			united by blood or birth or soil. We are bound by ideals that move 
			us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us 
			what it means to be citizens. Every child must be taught these 
			principles. Every citizen must uphold them. And every immigrant, by 
			embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.Today -- Today we affirm a new 
			commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility, 
			courage, compassion, and character. America, at its best, 
			matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility. A 
			civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fair 
			dealing and forgiveness.Some seem to believe 
			that our politics can afford to be petty because, in a time of 
			peace, the stakes of our debates appear small. But the stakes for 
			America are never small. If our country does not lead the cause of 
			freedom, it will not be led. If we do not turn the hearts of 
			children toward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts 
			and undermine their idealism. If we permit our economy to drift and 
			decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.We must live up to the 
			calling we share. Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment. It is the 
			determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. 
			And this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared 
			accomplishment.America, at its best, is 
			also courageous. Our national courage has 
			been clear in times of depression and war, when defeating common 
			dangers defined our common good. Now we must choose if the example 
			of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us. We must 
			show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead 
			of passing them on to future generations.Together, we will 
			reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more 
			young lives. We will reform Social 
			Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have 
			the power to prevent. And we'll reduce taxes, to recover the 
			momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of 
			working Americans. We will build our 
			defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite challenge. We will confront weapons 
			of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors.The enemies of liberty 
			and our country should make no mistake: America remains engaged in 
			the world by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that 
			favors freedom. We will defend our allies and our interests. We will 
			show purpose without arrogance. We will meet aggression and bad 
			faith with resolve and strength. And to all nations, we will speak 
			for the values that gave our nation birth.America, at its best, is 
			compassionate. In the quiet of American conscience, we know that 
			deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise. And whatever our views 
			of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault. 
			Abandonment and abuse are not acts of God, they are failures of 
			love. And the proliferation of 
			prisons, however necessary, is no substitute for hope and order in 
			our souls. Where there is 
			suffering, there is duty. Americans in need are not strangers, they 
			are citizens, not problems, but priorities. And all of us are 
			diminished when any are hopeless.Government has great 
			responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil 
			rights and common schools. Yet compassion is the work of a nation, 
			not just a government. And some needs and hurts 
			are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's 
			prayer. Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our 
			communities their humanity, and they will have an honored place in 
			our plans and in our laws.Many in our country do 
			not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who do.
			And I can pledge our 
			nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to 
			Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.America, at its best, is 
			a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected. Encouraging 
			responsibility is not a search for scapegoats, it is a call to 
			conscience. And though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper 
			fulfillment. We find the fullness of life not only in options, but 
			in commitments. And we find that children and community are the 
			commitments that set us free.Our public interest 
			depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and 
			basic fairness, on -- on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency which give 
			direction to our freedom. Sometimes in life we're 
			called to do great things. But as a saint of our times has said, 
			every day we are called to ""do small things with great love.""1The most 
			important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone.I will live and lead by 
			these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue 
			the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and 
			compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it as well.
			In all these ways, I 
			will bring the values of our history to the care of our times.What you do is as 
			important as anything government does. I ask you to seek a common 
			good beyond your comfort; to defend needed reforms against easy 
			attacks; to serve your nation, beginning with your neighbor. I ask 
			you to be citizens: citizens, not spectators; citizens, not 
			subjects; responsible citizens, building communities of service and 
			a nation of character.Americans are generous 
			and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves, but 
			because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves. When this spirit of 
			citizenship is missing, no government program can replace it. When 
			this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.After the Declaration of 
			Independence was signed, Virginia statesman John Page wrote to 
			Thomas Jefferson: ""We know the race is not to the swift nor the 
			battle to the strong. Do you not think an angel rides in the 
			whirlwind and directs this storm?""Much time has passed 
			since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration. The years and changes 
			accumulate. But the themes of this day he would know: our nation's 
			grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity.We are not this story's 
			Author, who fills time and eternity with His purpose. Yet His 
			purpose is achieved in our duty, and our duty is fulfilled in 
			service to one another.Never tiring, never 
			yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today, to make our 
			country more just and generous, to affirm the dignity of our lives 
			and every life.This work continues. 
			The story goes on. And an angel still rides in the whirlwind and 
			directs this storm.God bless you all, and 
			God bless America.",ice rehnquist president carter president bush president clinton distinguish guest fellow citizen peaceful transfer authority rare history yet common country simple oath affirm

2,22 January 2001,>George W. Bush - White House Staff Swearing In Spee,"Thank you. Don't go overboard. Sit 
		down, please -- no place to sit. Okay, don't sit down.Thank you all for coming.Mr. Vice President, thank you very much.Chief 
		of Staff Card, I'm honored to have you by my side. I started work this 
		morning and there he was, smiling and ready to go on behalf of the 
		American people.The First Lady and I have -- are honored to be living here and we're honored to 
		be hosting this event, the first we've done in this glorious room since 
		-- since theInauguration.I want to thank the family members who are here; thank you for your 
		sacrifice; thank you for the long hours, accepting the long hours that 
		your loved one is about to put in on behalf of the American people. Some 
		of the folks that are here have worked in past Administrations. Some of 
		us, this is a new experience. But for all of us, it is an honor of a 
		lifetime and it is our privilege to share this together.I am here to lead the Executive Branch of government. You all are here 
		because you have my full confidence. And we are here with the same basic 
		purpose: to serve the American people. We have alltaken an oath, and 
		from this moment on it is our jobs to honor it.Today, everything is so promising and new. My hope is that the day will 
		never come when any of us take[s] this place for granted, and this honor 
		for granted. As we serve, we must always remember three things:First, 
		we must remember the high standards that come with high office. This 
		begins with careful adherence to the rules. I expect every member of 
		this Administration to stay well within the boundaries that define legal 
		and ethical conduct.
		This means avoiding even the appearance of problems. This means checking 
		and, if need be, double-checking that the rules have been obeyed. This 
		means never compromising those rules. No one in the White House should 
		be afraid to confront the people they work for, for ethical concerns. 
		And no one should hesitate to confront me, as well. We're all 
		accountable to one another. And above all, we're all accountable to the 
		law and to the American people. MyWhite House Counsel,Al Gonzalez, is 
		my point man on these issues. If you have even a hint of ethical doubt, I 
		urge you to talk to Al.Second, we must remember that high standards of conduct involve not only 
		obeying the law, but showing civility. As we go about our work there is 
		no excuse for arrogance, and never a reason for disrespect toward 
		others. People who work here are highly visible throughout the 
		government. In many way -- In many of your dealings, you'll be the face and voice of the 
		White House staff. You'll be my representative. I expect each of you, 
		as an official of this Administration, to be an example of humility and 
		decency and fairness.And, finally, we must all remember that we are here for a reason. You 
		and I and the Vice President share the same goals for our country and 
		the same commitment to achieving them. We are here to make progress. We 
		are not here just to mark time. The next few weeks we'll affirm the 
		central policy goals of this Administration, beginning this week with 
		education reform. Everyone will know where we stand. Everyone will know 
		where we're headed. Every morning I want you to remember these goals. 
		Every evening I want you to review the progress we have made. I want it 
		said of us, at the end of our service, that ""promises made were promises 
		kept.""On a mantle piece in this Great House is inscribed the prayer of John 
		Adams, that only the ""wise"" and ""honest"" may ""rule under this roof.""1He was 
		speaking of those who live here. But wisdom and honesty are also 
		required of those who work here. I know each of you is capable of

3,29 January 2001,>George W. Bush - Faith Based Initiatives Signing Addre,"Good morning. Thank you all for coming. I take great joy in making this 
		announcement. It's going to be one of the most importantinitiativesthat my Administration not only discusses, but implements.First, it's good to have so many groups represented here -- religious 
		and non-religious; Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, and Muslim; foundations 
		and other non-profits. I want to thank you all for coming.This is a collection of some of the finest America has got to offer -- 
		people who lead with their hearts, and in turn, have changed the 
		communities in which they live for the better. This meeting is a picture 
		of the strength and diversity and compassion of our country.This is a diverse group, but we share things in common. We provide more 
		than -- They provide 
		more than practical help to people in need. They touch and change 
		hearts. And for this, America is deeply appreciative.Everyone in this room knows firsthand that there are still deep needs 
		and real suffering in the shadow of America's affluence. Problems like 
		addiction and abandonment and gang violence, domestic violence, mental 
		illness and homelessness. We are called by conscience to respond.As I said in myInaugural 
		Address, ""compassion is the work of a nation, 
		not just a government."" It is more than the calling of politicians; it is 
		the calling of citizens. It is citizens who turn mean streets into good 
		neighborhoods. It is citizens who turn cold cities into real 
		communities.It is one of the great goals of my Administration to invigorate the 
		spirit of involvement and citizenship. We will encourage faith-based and 
		community programs without changing their mission. We will help all in 
		their work to change hearts while keeping a commitment to pluralism.I approach this goal with some basic principles: Government has 
		important responsibilities for public health or public order and civil 
		rights. Yet government -- And government will never be replaced by 
		charities and community groups. Yet when we see social needs in America, 
		my Administration will look first to faith-based programs and community 
		groups, which have proven their power to save and change lives. We will 
		not fund the religious activities of any group, but when people of faith 
		provide social services, we will not discriminate against them.As long as there are secular alternatives, faith-based charities should 
		be able to compete for funding on an equal basis, and in a manner that 
		does not cause them to sacrifice their mission. And we will make sure 
		that help goes to large organizations and to small ones as well. We 
		value large organizations with generations of experience. We also value 
		neighborhood healers, who have only the scars and testimony of their own 
		experience.Tomorrow I will begin turning these principles into a legislative 
		agenda. I will send to Congress a series of ideas and proposals. Today, 
		I want to raise the priority and profile of these issues within my own 
		Administration. I want to ensure that faith-based and community groups 
		will always have a place at the table in our deliberations.In a few moments, I will sign two executive orders. Thefirst executive 
		orderwill create a new office, called theWhite House Office of 
		Faith-based and Community Initiatives. The head of this office will 
		report directly to me and be charged with important responsibilities. He 
		will oversee our initiatives on this issue. He will make sure our 
		government, where it works with private groups, is fair and supportive. 
		And he will highlight groups as national models so others can learn from 
		them.Thesecond executive orderwill clear away the bureaucratic barriers in 
		several important agencies that make private groups hesitate to work 
		with government. It will establish centers in five agencies --Justice,HUD,HHS,LaborandEducation-- to ensure greater cooperation between 
		the government and the independent sector. These centers will report 
		back on regulatory barriers to working with non-profit groups, and make 
		recommendations on how those barriers can be removed.I have put this broad effort into the hands of two exceptional people -- 
		first,Steve Goldsmith, known as one of the most innovative mayors in 
		America, who pioneered ways to promote community efforts. He will 
		continue to advise me on these issues. And I have asked Steve to serve 
		on the board of theCorporation for National Service.This organization has done some good work in mobilizing volunteers of 
		all ages. I've asked Steve to report to me on how we can make the 
		corporation do better, and to get help where it's most needed.And secondly, ProfessorJohn Diluliowill head the new office I am 
		announcing today. He is one of the most influential social entrepreneurs 
		in America. I can't tell you how honored I am for him to leave his post 
		in academia to join us. He is the author of a respected textbook on 
		American government. He has a servant's heart on the issues that we will 
		confront. He's worked with disadvantaged children. He has been a major 
		force in mobilizing the city of -- of Philadelphia to support faith-based and 
		community groups.It's a fantastic team. I'm honored to have them on my team. I look 
		forward to hearing from them, as well as I look forward to working with 
		the people in this room and the social entrepreneurs all across America 
		who have heard the universal call to love a neighbor like they'd like to 
		be loved themselves; to exist and work hard, not out of the love of 
		money, but out of the love of their fellow human beings. I'm absolutely 
		convinced the great fabric of the nation exists in neighborhoods, 
		amongst unsung heroes who do heroic acts on a daily and hourly basis. 
		It's the fabric of the country that makes America unique. It is -- The 
		power of promise that makes the future so promising is the power of the 
		missions that stand behind me.This is an effort that will be an effort from, now the second week of my 
		Administration to the last week of my Administration, because I'm 
		confident that this initiative, when fully implemented, will help us 
		realize the dream that America, its hopes, its promise, its greatness, 
		will extend its reach throughout every single neighborhood, all across 
		the land.And now it is my honor to sign the two executive orders.",good morning thank come take great joy make announcement go one importantinitiativesthat administration discus good many group

4,01 February 2001,>George W. Bush - First National Prayer Brreakfast Addre,"Well, thank you all very much for that warm welcome. Laura and I are 
		honored to be here this morning. I did a pretty good job when it came to 
		picking my wife, by the way. She's going to be afabulous First Lady.Mr. Vice President, it's good to see you; of course, your wife, Lynn. 
		And I want to thank the members of my Cabinet who are here. I appreciate 
		you, Senator Frist, for your commitment and strong comments. And, Zach, 
		thanks for your introduction. And thank you both for organizing this 
		important event.I want to thank the members of the House and the Senate who are here. I 
		appreciate the number of foreign dignitaries who are here. It just goes 
		to show that faith crosses every border, and touches every heart in 
		every nation.Every President since the first one I can remember, Dwight Eisenhower, 
		has taken part inthis great tradition. It's a privilege for me to speak 
		where they have spoken, and to pray where they have prayed. All 
		Presidents of the United States have come to the National Prayer 
		Breakfast, regardless of their religious views. No matter what our 
		background, in prayer we share something universal -- a desire to speak 
		and listen to our Maker, and to know His plan for our lives.America's Constitution forbids a religious test for office, and that's 
		the way it should be. An American President serves people of every 
		faith, and serves some of no faith at all. Yet I have found my faith 
		helps me in the service to people. Faith teaches humility. As Laura 
		would say, I ""could use a dose occasionally."" A recognition that we are 
		small in God's universe, yet precious in His sight. It has sustained me 
		in moments of success, and in moments of disappointment. Without it I'd be a different person, and without it I doubt I'd be here today.There are many experiences of faith in this room. But most of us share a 
		belief that we are loved, and called to love; that our choices matter, 
		now and forever; that there are purposes deeper than ambition and hopes 
		greater than success. These beliefs shape our lives and help sustain the 
		life of our nation. Men and women can be good without faith, but faith 
		is a force of goodness. Men and women can be compassionate without 
		faith, but faith often inspires compassion. Human beings can love 
		without faith, but faith is a great teacher of love.Our country, from its beginnings has recognized the contribution of 
		faith. We do not impose any religion; we welcome all religions. We do 
		not prescribe any prayer; we welcome all prayer[s]. This is the tradition 
		of our nation, and it will be the standard of my Administration.  We will respect every creed. We will honor the diversity of 
		our country and the deep convictions of our people.There's a good reason why many in our nation embrace the faith 
		tradition. Throughout our history people of faith have often been our 
		nation's voice of conscience. The foes of slavery could appeal to the 
		standard that all are created equal in the sight of our Lord. The civil 
		rights movement had the same conviction on its side -- that men and 
		women bearing God's image should not be exploited and set aside, and 
		treated as insignificant. The same impulse over the years has reformed 
		prisons and mental institutions, hospitals, hospices, and homeless 
		shelters.The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. said this: ""The church must be 
		reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state, but 
		rather the conscience of the state.""1As in his case, that sometimes 
		means defying the times, challenging old ways and old assumptions. This 
		influence has made our nation more just and generous and decent. And our 
		nation has need of that today.Faith remains an important -- remains important to the compassion of our nation. Millions of 
		Americans serve their neighbor because they love their God. Their lives 
		are characterized by kindness and patience, and service to others. They 
		do for others what no government really can ever do -- no government 
		program can really ever do: They provide love for another human being. 
		They provide hope even when hope comes hard.In my second week in office we have set out to promote the work of 
		community and faith-based charities. We want to encourage the inspired, 
		to help the helper. Government cannot be replaced by charities, but it 
		can welcome them as partners instead of resenting them as rivals.My Administration will put the federal government squarely on the side 
		of America's armies of compassion. Our plan will not favor religious 
		institutions over non-religious institutions. As President, I'm 
		interested in what is constitutional, and I'm interested in what works.  The days of discriminating against religious institutions, 
		simply because they are religious, must come to an end.Faith is also important to the civility of our country. It teaches us 
		not merely to tolerate one another, but to respect one another -- to 
		show a regard for different views and the courtesy to listen. This is 
		essential to democracy. It is also the proper way to treat human beings 
		created in the divine image.We will have our disagreements. Civility does not require us to abandon 
		deeply-held beliefs. Civility does not demand casual creeds and 
		colorless convictions. Americans have always believed that civility and 
		firm resolve could live easily with one another. But civility does mean 
		that our public debate ought to be free from bitterness and anger and 
		rancor and ill-will.  We have an obligation to make our case, 
		not to demonize our opponents.  As the Book of James reminds 
		us, fresh water and salt water cannot flow from the same spring.2I'm under no illusion that civility will triumph in this city all at 
		once. Old habits die hard -- and sometimes they never die at 
		all. But I can only pledge to you this; that I will do my very best to 
		promote civility, and ask for the same in return.These are some of the crucial contributions of faith to our nation: 
		justice, and compassion, and a civil and generous society. I thank you 
		all here for displaying these values, and defending them, here in America and 
		across the world. You strengthen the ties of friendship and the ties of 
		nation[s]. And I deeply appreciate your work.I believe in the power of prayer. It's been said: ""I would rather stand 
		against the cannons of the wicked than against the prayers of the 
		righteous."" The prayers of a friend are one of life's most gracious 
		gifts. My family and I are blessed by the prayers of countless 
		Americans. Over the last several months, Laura and I have been touched 
		by the number of people who come up and say, ""We pray for you."" Such 
		comforting words. I hope Americans will continue to pray that everyone 
		in my Administration finds wisdom, and always remembers the common good.When President Harry Truman took office in 1945, he said this: ""At this 
		moment, I have in my heart a prayer. I ask only to be a good and 
		faithful servant of my Lord and my people.""3This has been the prayer of 
		many Presidents, and it is mine today.God bless.",well thank much warm welcome laura honor morning pretty good job come pick wife way go afabulous first vice president good see course wife lynn want

for pdfMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, 

members of Congress: It's a great privilege to be here to outline a new budget 

and a new approach for governing our great country. I thank you for your 

invitation to speak here tonight. I know Congress had to formally invite me, and 

it could have been a close vote. So, Mr. Vice President, I appreciate you being 

here to break the tie.I want to thank so many of you who 

have accepted my invitation to come to the White House to discuss important 

issues. We're off to a good start. I will continue to meet with you and ask for 

your input. You have been kind and candid, and I thank you for making a new 

President feel welcome.The last time I visited the Capitol, 

I came to take an oath on the steps of this building. I pledged to honor our 

Constitution and laws. And I asked you to join me in setting a tone of civility 

and respect in Washington.I hope America is noticing the 

difference, because we're making progress. Together, we are changing the tone in 

the Nation's Capital. And this spirit of respect and cooperation is vital, 

because, in the end, we will be judged not only by what we say or how we say it, 

we will be judged by what we're able to accomplish.America today is a nation with great 

challenges, but greater resources. An artist using statistics as a brush could 

paint two very different pictures of our country. One would have warning signs: 

increasing layoffs, rising energy prices, too many failing schools, persistent 

poverty, the stubborn vestiges of racism. Another picture would be full of 

blessings: a balanced budget, big surpluses, a military that is second to none, 

a country at peace with its neighbors, technology that is revolutionizing the 

world, and our greatest strength -- concerned citizens who care for our country 

and care for each other.Neither picture is complete in and 

of itself. And tonight I challenge and invite Congress to work with me to use 

the resources of one picture to repaint the other; to direct the advantages of 

our time to solve the problems of our people. Some of these resources will come 

from government. Some, but not all.Year after year in Washington, 

budget debates seem to come down to an old, tired argument: on one side, those 

who want more government, regardless of the cost; on the other, those who want 

less government, regardless of the need. We should leave those arguments to the 

last century, and chart a different course.Government has a role, and an 

important role. Yet, too much government crowds out initiative and hard work, 

private charity and the private economy. Our new governing vision says 

government should be active, but limited; engaged, but not overbearing. And my 

budget is based on that philosophy.It is reasonable, and it is 

responsible. It meets our obligations, and funds our growing needs. We increase 

spending next year for Social Security and Medicare, and other entitlement 

programs, by $81 billion. We've increased spending for discretionary programs by 

a very responsible 4 percent, above the rate of inflation. My plan pays down an 

unprecedented amount of our national debt. And then, when money is still left 

over, my plan returns it to the people who earned it in the first place.A budget's impact is counted in 

dollars, but measured in lives. Excellent schools, quality health care, a secure 

retirement, a cleaner environment, a stronger defense -- these are all important 

needs, and we fund them. The highest percentage increase in our budget should go 

to our children's education. Education is not my top priority -- education is my 

top priority and, by supporting this budget, you'll make it yours, as well.Reading is the foundation of all 

learning. So during the next five years, we triple spending, adding $5 billion 

to help every child in America learn to read. Values are important, so we've 

tripled funding for character education to teach our children not only reading 

and writing, but right from wrong.We've increased funding to train and 

recruit teachers, because we know a good education starts with a good teacher. 

And I have a wonderful partner in this effort. I like teachers so much, I 

married one. Laura has begun a new effort to recruit Americans to the profession 

that will shape our future -- teaching. She will travel across America to 

promote sound teaching practices and early reading skills in our schools and in 

programs such as Head Start.When it comes to our schools, 

dollars alone do not always make the difference. Funding is important, and so is 

reform. So we must tie funding to higher standards and accountability for 

results.I believe in local control of 

schools. We should not, and we will not, run public schools from Washington, 

D.C. Yet when the federal government spends tax dollars, we must insist on 

results. Children should be tested on basic reading and math skills every year 

between grades three and eight. Measuring is the only way to know whether all 

our children are learning. And I want to know, because I refuse to leave any 

child behind in America.Critics of testing contend it 

distracts from learning. They talk about teaching to the test. But let's put 

that logic to the test. If you test a child on basic math and reading skills, 

and you're teaching to the test, you're teaching math and reading. And that's 

the whole idea. As standards rise, local schools will need more flexibility to 

meet them. So we must streamline the dozens of federal education programs into 

five, and let states spend money in those categories as they see fit.Schools will be given a reasonable 

chance to improve and the support to do so. Yet, if they don't, if they continue 

to fail, we must give parents and students different options -- a better public 

school, a private school, tutoring or a charter school. In the end, every child 

in a bad situation must be given a better choice because, when it comes to our 

children, failure is simply not an option.Another priority in my budget is to 

keep the vital promises of Medicare and Social Security, and together we will do 

so. To meet the health care needs of all America's seniors, we double the 

Medicare budget over the next 10 years. My budget dedicates $238 billion to 

Medicare next year alone, enough to fund all current programs and to begin a new 

prescription drug benefit for low-income seniors. No senior in America should 

have to choose between buying food and buying prescriptions.To make sure the retirement savings 

of America's seniors are not diverted in any other program, my budget protects 

all $2.6 trillion of the Social Security surplus for Social Security, and for 

Social Security alone.My budget puts a priority on access 

to health care, without telling Americans what doctor they have to see or what 

coverage they must choose. Many working Americans do not have health care 

coverage, so we will help them buy their own insurance with refundable tax 

credits. And to provide quality care in low-income neighborhoods, over the next 

five years we will double the number of people served at community health care 

centers.And we will address the concerns of 

those who have health coverage, yet worry their insurance company doesn't care 

and won't pay. Together this Congress and this President will find common ground 

to make sure doctors make medical decisions, and patients get the health care 

they deserve with a patients' bill of rights.When it comes to their health, 

people want to get the medical care they need, not be forced to go to court 

because they didn't get it. We will ensure access to the courts for those with 

legitimate claims. But first, let's put in place a strong, independent review so 

we promote quality health care, not frivolous lawsuits.My budget also increases funding for 

medical research, which gives hope to many who struggle with serious disease. 

Our prayers tonight are with one of your own who is engaged in his own fight 

against cancer -- a fine representative, and a good man, Congressman Joe 

Moakley. I can think of no more appropriate tribute to Joe than to have the 

Congress finish the job of doubling the budget for the National Institutes of 

Health.My new Freedom Initiative for 

Americans with Disabilities funds new technologies, expands opportunities to 

work, and makes our society more welcoming. For the more than 50 million 

Americans with disabilities, we need to break down barriers to equality.The budget I propose to you also 

supports the people who keep our country strong and free, the men and women who 

serve in the United States military. I'm requesting $5.7 billion in increased 

military pay and benefits, and health care and housing. Our men and women in 

uniform give America their best and we owe them our support.America's veterans honored their 

commitment to our country through their military service. I will honor our 

commitment to them with a million-dollar increase to ensure better access to 

quality care and faster decisions on benefit claims.My budget will improve our 

environment by accelerating the cleanup of toxic brownfields. And I propose we 

make a major investment in conservation by fully funding the Land and Water 

Conservation Fund. Our national parks have a special place in our country's 

life. Our parks are places of great natural beauty and history. As good 

stewards, we must leave them better than we found them. So I propose providing 

$4.9 billion over five years for the upkeep of these national treasures.And my budget adopts a hopeful new 

approach to help the poor and the disadvantaged. We must encourage and support 

the work of charities and faith-based and community groups that offer help and 

love one person at a time. These groups are working in every neighborhood in 

America to fight homelessness and addiction and domestic violence; to provide a 

hot meal or a mentor or a safe haven for our children. Government should welcome 

these groups to apply for funds, not discriminate against them.Government cannot be replaced by 

charities or volunteers. Government should not fund religious activities.  

But our nation should support the good works of these good people who are 

helping their neighbors in need. So I propose allowing all taxpayers, whether 

they itemize or not, to deduct their charitable contributions. Estimates show 

this could encourage as much as $14 billion a year in new charitable giving, 

money that will save and change lives.Our budget provides more than $700 

million over the next 10 years for a federal compassion capital fund, with a 

focused and noble mission, to provide a mentor to the more than 100 million 

children with a parent in prison, and to support other local efforts to fight 

illiteracy, teen pregnancy, drug addiction and other difficult problems.With us tonight is the Mayor of 

Philadelphia. Please help me welcome Mayor John Street. Mayor Street has 

encouraged faith-based and community organizations to make a significant 

difference in Philadelphia. He's invited me to his city this summer to see 

compassionate action. I'm personally aware of just how effective the Mayor is. 

Mayor Street's a Democrat. Let the record show, I lost his city, big time. But 

some things are bigger than politics. So I look forward to coming to your city, 

to see your faith-based programs in action.As government promotes compassion, 

it also must promote justice. Too many of our citizens have cause to doubt our 

nation's justice, when the law points a finger of suspicion at groups, instead 

of individuals. All our citizens are created equal, and must be treated equally.Earlier today, I asked John 

Ashcroft, the Attorney General, to develop specific recommendations to end 

racial profiling. It's wrong and we will end it in America. In so doing, we will 

not hinder the work of our nation's brave police officers. They protect us every 

day -- often at great risk. But by stopping the abuses of a few, we will add to 

the public confidence our police officers earn and deserve.My budget has funded a responsible 

increase in our ongoing operations. It has funded our nation's important 

priorities. It has protected Social Security and Medicare. And our surpluses are 

big enough that there is still money left over.Many of you have talked about the 

need to pay down our national debt. I listened, and I agree. We owe it to our 

children and grandchildren to act now, and I hope you will join me to pay down 

$2 trillion in debt during the next 10 years. At the end of those 10 years, we 

will have paid down all the debt that is available to retire. That is more debt, 

repaid more quickly than has ever been repaid by any nation at any time in 

history.We should also prepare for the 

unexpected, for the uncertainties of the future. We should approach our nation's 

budget as any prudent family would, with a contingency fund for emergencies or 

additional spending needs. For example, after a strategic review, we may need to 

increase defense spending. We may need to increase spending for our farmers or 

additional money to reform Medicare. And so, my budget sets aside almost a 

trillion dollars over 10 years for additional needs. That is one trillion 

additional reasons you can feel comfortable supporting this budget.We have increased our budget at a 

responsible 4 percent. We have funded our priorities. We paid down all the 

available debt. We have prepared for contingencies. And we still have money left 

over.Yogi Berra once said, ""When you come 

to a fork in the road, take it."" Now, we come to a fork in the road; we have two 

choices. Even though we have already met our needs, we could spend the money on 

more and bigger government. That's the road our nation has traveled in recent 

years.Last year, government spending shot 

up 8 percent. That's far more than our economy grew, far more than personal 

income grew, and far more than the rate of inflation. If you continue on that 

road, you will spend the surplus and have to dip into Social Security to pay 

other bills. Unrestrained government spending is a dangerous road to deficits, 

so we must take a different path. The other choice is to let the American people 

spend their own money to meet their own needs.I hope you will join me in standing 

firmly on the side of the people. You see, the growing surplus exists because 

taxes are too high and government is charging more than it needs. The people of 

America have been overcharged and, on their behalf, I am here asking for a 

refund.Some say my tax plan is too big. 

Others say it's too small. I respectfully disagree. This plan is just right. I 

didn't throw darts at the board to come up with a number for tax relief. I 

didn't take a poll or develop an arbitrary formula that might sound good. I 

looked at problems in the Tax Code and calculated the cost to fix them.A tax rate of 15 percent is too high 

for those who earn low wages, so we must lower the rate to 10 percent. No one 

should pay more than a third of the money they earn in federal income taxes, so 

we lowered the top rate to 33 percent.This reform will be welcome relief 

for America's small businesses, which often pay taxes at the highest rate. And 

help for small business means jobs for Americans. We simplified the Tax Code by 

reducing the number of tax rates from the current five rates to four lower ones, 

10 percent, 15, 25 and 33 percent. In my plan, no one is targeted in or targeted 

out. Everyone who pays income taxes will get relief.Our government should not tax, and 

thereby discourage marriage, so we reduced the marriage penalty. I want to help 

families rear and support their children, so we doubled the child credit to 

$1,000 per child. It's not fair to tax the same earnings twice -- once when you 

earn them, and again when you die -- so we must repeal the death tax.These changes add up to significant 

help. A typical family with two children will save $1,600 a year on their 

federal income taxes. Now, $1,600 may not sound like a lot to some, but it means 

a lot to many families: $1,600 buys gas for two cars for an entire year; it pays 

tuition for a year at a community college; it pays the average family grocery 

bill for three months. That's real money.With us tonight representing many 

American families are Steven and Josefina Ramos. They are from Pennsylvania. But 

they could be from any one of your districts. Steven is the network 

administrator for a school district. Josefina is a Spanish teacher at a charter 

school. And they have a two-year-old daughter.Steven and Josefina tell me they pay 

almost $8,000 a year in federal income taxes. My plan will save them more than 

$2,000. Let me tell you what Steven says: ""Two thousand dollars a year means a 

lot to my family. If we had this money, it would help us reach our goal of 

paying off our personal debt in two years' time."" After that, Steven and 

Josefina want to start saving for Lianna's college education.My attitude is, government should 

never stand in the way of families achieving their dreams. And as we debate this 

issue, always remember, the surplus is not the government's money, the surplus 

is the people's money.For lower-income families, my tax 

plan restores basic fairness. Right now, complicated tax rules punish hard work. 

A waitress supporting two children on $25,000 a year can lose nearly half of 

every additional dollar she earns above the $25,000. Her overtime, her hardest 

hours, are taxed at nearly 20 percent. This sends a terrible message: you'll 

never get ahead. But America's message must be different. We must honor hard 

work, never punish it. With tax relief, overtime will no longer be over-taxed 

time for the waitress. People with the smallest incomes will get the highest 

percentage of reductions. And millions of additional American families will be 

removed from the income tax rolls entirely.Tax relief is right and tax relief 

is urgent. The long economic expansion that began almost 10 years ago is 

faltering. Lower interest rates will eventually help, but we cannot assume they 

will do the job all by themselves.Forty years ago, and then 20 years 

ago, two Presidents, one Democrat, one Republican, John F. Kennedy and Ronald 

Reagan, advocated tax cuts to, in President Kennedy's words, get this country 

moving again. They knew then what we must do now. To create economic growth and 

opportunity, we must put money back into the hands of the people who buy goods 

and create jobs.We must act quickly. The Chairman of 

the Federal Reserve has testified before Congress that tax cuts often come too 

late to stimulate economic recovery. So I want to work with you to give our 

economy an important jump-start by making tax relief retroactive.We must act now because it is the 

right thing to do. We must also act now because we have other things to do. We 

must show courage to confront and resolve tough challenges, to restructure our 

nation's defenses, to meet our growing need for energy, and to reform Medicare 

and Social Security.America has a window of opportunity 

to extend and secure our present peace by promoting a distinctly American 

internationalism. We will work with our allies and friends to be a force for 

good and a champion of freedom. We will work for free markets, free trade and 

freedom from oppression. Nations making progress toward freedom will find 

America is their friend. We will promote our values. We will promote the peace. 

And we need a strong military to keep the peace.But our military was shaped to 

confront the challenges of the past. So I've asked the Secretary of Defense to 

review America's Armed Forces and prepare to transform them to meet emerging 

threats. My budget makes a down payment on the research and development that 

will be required. Yet, in our broader transformation effort, we must put 

strategy first, then spending. Our defense vision will drive our defense budget, 

not the other way around.Our nation also needs a clear 

strategy to confront the threats of the 21st century -- threats that are more 

widespread and less certain. They range from terrorists who threaten with bombs 

to tyrants in rogue nations intent upon developing weapons of mass destruction. 

To protect our own people, our allies and friends, we must develop and we must 

deploy effective missile defenses.And as we transform our military, we 

can discard Cold War relics, and reduce our own nuclear forces to reflect 

today's needs. A strong America is the world's best hope for peace and freedom.Yet the cause of freedom rests on 

more than our ability to defend ourselves and our allies. Freedom is exported 

every day, as we ship goods and products that improve the lives of millions of 

people. Free trade brings greater political and personal freedom. Each of the 

previous five Presidents has had the ability to negotiate far reaching trade 

agreements. Tonight I ask you to give me the strong hand of presidential trade 

promotion authority, and to do so quickly.As we meet tonight, many citizens 

are struggling with the high cost of energy. We have a serious energy problem 

that demands a national energy policy. The West is confronting a major energy 

shortage that has resulted in high prices and uncertainty. I've asked federal 

agencies to work with California officials to help speed construction of new 

energy sources, and I have direct Vice President Cheney, Commerce Secretary 

Evans, Energy Secretary Abraham and other senior members in my administration to 

develop a national energy policy.Our energy demand outstrips our 

supply. We can produce more energy at home while protecting our environment, and 

we must. We can produce more electricity to meet demand, and we must. We can 

promote alternative energy sources and conservation, and we must. America must 

become more energy-independent, and we will.Perhaps the biggest test of our 

foresight and courage will be reforming Medicare and Social Security. Medicare's 

finances are strained and its coverage is outdated. Ninety-nine percent of 

employer-provided health plans offer some form of prescription drug coverage; 

Medicare does not. The framework for reform has been developed by Senators Frist 

and Breaux and Congressman Thomas, and now is the time to act.Medicare must be modernized, and we 

must make sure that every senior on Medicare can choose a health care plan that 

offers prescription drugs.Seven years from now, the baby boom 

generation will begin to claim Social Security benefits. Every one in this 

chamber knows that Social Security is not prepared to fully fund their 

retirement. And we only have a couple of years to get prepared. Without reform, 

this country will one day awaken to a stark choice: either a drastic rise in 

payroll taxes or a radical cut in retirement benefits.There is a better way. This spring I 

will form a presidential commission to reform Social Security. The commission 

will make its recommendations by next fall. Reform should be based on these 

principles: It must preserve the benefits of all current retirees and those 

nearing retirement. It must return Social Security to sound financial footing. 

And it must offer personal savings accounts to younger workers who want them.Social Security now offers workers a 

return of less than 2 percent on the money they pay into the system. To save the 

system, we must increase that by allowing younger workers to make safe, sound 

investments that yield a higher rate of return. Ownership, access to wealth and 

independence should not be the privilege of the few. They are the hope of every 

American, and we must make them the foundation of Social Security.By confronting the tough challenge 

of reform, by being responsible with our budget, we can earn the trust of the 

American people. And we can add to that trust by enacting fair and balanced 

election and campaign reforms.The agenda I have set before you 

tonight is worthy of a great nation. America is a nation at peace, but not a 

nation at rest. Much has been given to us, and much is expected. Let us agree to 

bridge old divides. But let us also agree that our goodwill must be dedicated to 

great goals. Bipartisan is more than minding our matters. It is doing our duty.No one can speak in this Capitol and 

not be awed by its history. As so many turning points, debates in these chambers 

have reflected the collected or divided conscience of our country. And when we 

walk through Statuary Hall and see those men and women of marble, we're reminded 

of their courage and achievement.Yet America's purpose is never found 

only in statues or history. America's purpose always stands before us. Our 

generation must show courage in a time of blessing, as our nation has always 

shown in times of crisis. And our courage, issue by issue, can gather to 

greatness and serve our country. This is the privilege and responsibility we 

share. And if we work together, we can prove that public service is noble.We all came here for a reason. We 

all have things we want to accomplish and promises to keep.Juntos podemos-- 

together we can.We can make Americans proud of their 

government. Together we can share in the credit of making our country more 

prosperous and generous and just, and earn from our conscience and from our 

fellow citizens the highest possible praise: Well done, good and faithful 

servants.Thank you all. Good night and God 

bless.Also in this database:2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,20082009,20102011201220132014201520162017State of the Union AddressesText and Image Source:

for pdfGood evening. I appreciate you giving
me a few minutes of your time tonight so
I can discuss with you a complex and difficult
issue, an issue that is one of the most profound
of our time.The issue of research involving stem
cells derived from human embryos is
increasingly the subject of a national
debate and dinner table discussions. The
issue is confronted every day in
laboratories as scientists ponder the
ethical ramifications of their work. It
is agonized over by parents and many
couples as they try to have children or
to save children already born. The issue
is debated within the church, with people
of different faiths, even many of the
same faith, coming to different
conclusions.Many people are finding that the more
they know about stem cell research, the
less certain they are about the right
ethical and moral conclusions.My administration must decide whether to
allow federal funds, your tax dollars, to
be used for scientific research on stem
cells derived from human embryos.A large number of these embryos already
exist. They are the product of a process
called in vitro fertilization which helps
so many couples conceive children. When
doctors match sperm and egg to create
life outside the womb, they usually
produce more embryos than are implanted
in the mother. Once a couple successfully
has children or if they are unsuccessful,
the additional embryos remain frozen in
laboratories. Some will not survive
during long storage, others are
destroyed. A number have been donated to
science and used to create privately
funded stem cell lines. And a few have 
been implanted in an adoptive mother and
born and are today healthy children.Based on preliminary work that has been
privately funded, scientists believe
further research using stem cells offers
great promise that could help improve the
lives of those who suffer from many
terrible diseases, from juvenile diabetesto Alzheimer, from Parkinsons to spinal
cord injuries. And while scientists admit
they are not yet certain, they believe
stem cells derived from embryos have
unique potential.You should also know that stem cells can
be derived from sources other than
embryos: from adult cells, from umbilical
cords that are discarded after babies are
born, from human placentas. And many 
scientists feel research on these types
of stem cells is also promising. Many
patients suffering from a range of
diseases are already being helped with
treatments developed from adult stem
cells.However, most scientists, at least today,
believe that research on embryonic stem
cells offers the most promise because
these cells have the potential to develop
in all of the tissues in the body.Scientists further believe that rapid
progress in this research will come only
with federal funds. Federal dollars help
attract the best and brightest
scientists. They ensure new discoveries
are widely shared at the largest number
of research facilities, and that the
research is directed toward the greatest 
public good.The United States has a long and proud
record of leading the world toward
advances in science and medicine that
improve human life, and the United States
has a long and proud record of upholding
the highest standards of ethics as we
expand the limits of science and
knowledge.Research on embryonic stem cells raises
profound ethical questions, because
extracting the stem cell destroys the
embryo, and thus destroys its potential
for life.Like a snowflake, each of these embryos
is unique, with the unique genetic
potential of an individual human being.As I thought through this issue I kept
returning to two fundamental questions.
First, are these frozen embryos human
life and therefore something precious to
be protected? And second, if they're
going to be destroyed anyway, shouldn't
they be used for a greater good, for
research that has the potential to save
and improve other lives?I've asked those questions and others of
scientists, scholars, bio-ethicists,
religious leaders, doctors, researchers,
members of Congress, my Cabinet and my
friends. I have read heartfelt letters
from many Americans. I have given this
issue a great deal of thought, prayer,
and considerable reflection, and I have
found widespread disagreement.On the first issue, are these embryos
human life? Well, one researcher told me
he believes this five-day-old cluster of
cells is not an embryo, not yet an
individual but a pre-embryo. He argued
that it has the potential for life, but
it is not a life because it cannot
develop on its own.An ethicist dismissed that as a callous
attempt at rationalization. ""Make no
mistake,"" he told me, ""that cluster of
cells is the same way you and I, and all
the rest of us, started our lives. One
goes with a heavy heart if we use these,""
he said, ""because we are dealing with the
seeds of the next generation.""And to the other crucial question -- If
these are going to be destroyed anyway,
why not use them for good purpose? -- I
also found different answers.Many are these embryos are byproducts of
a process that helps create life and we
should allow couples to donate them to
science so they can be used for good
purpose instead of wasting theirpotential.Others will argue there is no such thing
as excess life and the fact that a living
being is going to die does not justify
experimenting on it or exploiting it as a
natural resource.At its core, this issue forces us to
confront fundamental questions about the
beginnings of life and the ends of
science. It lives at a difficult moral
intersection, juxtaposing the need to
protect life in all its phases with the
prospect of saving and improving life in
all its stages.As the discoveries of modern science
create tremendous hope, they also lay
vast ethical mine fields.As the genius of science extends the
horizons of what we can do, we
increasingly confront complex questions
about what we should do. We have arrived
at that brave new world that seemed so
distant in 1932 when Alduous Huxley wrote
about human beings created in test tubes
in what he called a hatchery.In recent weeks, we learned that
scientists have created human embryos in
test tubes solely to experiment on them.
This is deeply troubling and a warning
sign that should prompt all of us to 
think through these issues very
carefully.Embryonic stem cell research is at the
leading edge of a series of moral
hazards. The initial stem cell researcher
was at first reluctant to begin his
research, fearing it might be used for
human cloning. Scientists have already
cloned a sheep. Researchers are telling
us the next step could be to clone human
beings to create individual designer stem
cells, essentially to grow another you,
to be available in case you need another
heart or lung or liver.I strongly oppose human cloning, as do
most Americans. We recoil at the idea of
growing human beings for spare body parts
or creating life for our convenience.And while we must devote enormous energy
to conquering disease, it is equally
important that we pay attention to the
moral concerns raised by the new frontier
of human embryo stem cell research. Even 
the most noble ends do not justify any
means.My position on these issues is shaped by
deeply held beliefs. I'm a strong
supporter of science and technology, and
believe they have the potential for
incredible good -- to improve lives, to
save life, to conquer disease. Research
offers hope that millions of our loved
ones may be cured of a disease and rid of
their suffering. I have friends whose
children suffer from juvenile diabetes.
Nancy Reagan has written me about
President Reagan's struggle with
Alzheimer's. My own family has confronted 
the tragedy of childhood leukemia. And
like all Americans, I have great hope for
cures.I also believe human life is a sacred
gift from our creator. I worry about a
culture that devalues life, and believe
as your president I have an important
obligation to foster and encourage
respect for life in America and
throughout the world.And while we're all hopeful about the
potential of this research, no one can be
certain that the science will live up to
the hope it has generated.Eight years ago, scientists believed
fetal tissue research offered great hope
for cures and treatments, yet the
progress to date has not lived up to its
initial expectations. Embryonic stem cell
research offers both great promise and
great peril, so I have decided we must
proceed with great care.As a result of private research, more
than 60 genetically diverse stem cell
lines already exist. They were created
from embryos that have already been
destroyed, and they have the ability to
regenerate themselves indefinitely,
creating ongoing opportunities for
research.I have concluded that we should allow
federal funds to be used for research on
these existing stem cell lines, where the
life-and- death decision has already been
made.Leading scientists tell me research on
these 60 lines has great promise that
could lead to breakthrough therapies and
cures. This allows us to explore the
promise and potential of stem cellresearch without crossing a fundamental
moral line by providing taxpayer funding
that would sanction or encourage further
destruction of human embryos that have at
least the potential for life.I also believe that great scientific
progress can be made through aggressive
federal funding of research on umbilical
cord, placenta, adult and animal stem
cells, which do not involve the same
moral dilemma. This year your government
will spent $250 million on this important
research.I will also name a president's council to
monitor stem cell research, to recommend
appropriate guidelines and regulations
and to consider all of the medical and
ethical ramifications of bio-medical 
innovation.This council will consist of leading
scientists, doctors, ethicists, lawyers,
theologians and others, and will be
chaired by Dr. Leon Cass, a leading
bio-medical ethicist from the University
of Chicago.This council will keep us apprised of new
developments and give our nation a forum
to continue to discuss and evaluate these
important issues.As we go forward, I hope we will always
be guided by both intellect and heart, by
both our capabilities and our conscience.I have made this decision with great
care, and I pray it is the right one.Thank you for listening. Good night, and
God bless America.",bush stem cell research stem cell researchdelivered august browser support video require flash audioyour browser support audio pdfgood even appreciate give minute time tonight

audio. (2)]Good evening.Today, our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack 
in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts. The victims were in 
airplanes or in their offices: secretaries, business men and women, military and 
federal workers, moms and dads, friends and neighbors. Thousands of lives were 
suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror. The pictures ofairplanes 
flying into buildings, fires burning, huge -- huge structures collapsing have filled us 
with disbelief, terrible sadness, and a quiet, unyielding anger. These acts of 
mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But 
they have failed. Our country is strong.A great people has been moved to defend a great 
nation. Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, 
but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel, but 
they cannot dent the steel of American resolve. America was targeted for attack 
because we're the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And 
no one will keep that light from shining. Today, our nation saw evil -- the very 
worst of human nature -- and we responded with the best of America. With the 
daring of our rescue workers, with the caring for strangers and neighbors who 
came to give blood and help in any way they could.Immediately following the first attack, I 
implemented our government's emergency response plans. Our military is powerful, 
and it's prepared. Our emergency teams are working in New York City and 
Washington D.C. to help with local rescue efforts. Our first priority is to get 
help to those who have been injured, and to take every precaution to protect our 
citizens at home and around the world from further attacks. The functions of our 
government continue without interruption. Federal agencies in Washington which 
had to be evacuated today are reopening for essential personnel tonight and will 
be open for business tomorrow. Our financial institutions remain strong, and the 
American economy will be open for business as well.The search is underway for those who were behind 
these evil acts. I have directed the full resources of our intelligence and law 
enforcement communities to find those responsible and to bring them to justice. 
We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and 
those who harbor them.I appreciate so very much the members of Congress 
who have joined me in strongly condemning these attacks. And on behalf of the 
American people, I thank the many world leaders who have called to offer their 
condolences and assistance. America and our friends and allies join with all 
those who want peace and security in the world, and we stand together to win the 
war against terrorism.Tonight, I ask for your prayers for all those who 
grieve, for the children whose worlds have been shattered, for all whose sense 
of safety and security has been threatened. And I pray they will be comforted by 
a Power greater than any of us, spoken through the ages in Psalm 23:Even though I walk through 
the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil for you are with me.This is a day when all Americans 
from every walk of life unite in our resolve for justice and peace. America has 
stood down enemies before, and we will do so this time. None of us will ever 
forget this day, yet we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and 
just in our world.Thank you. Good night.

today we express our nation's sorrow. We come before God to pray for the missing and the
dead, and for those who loved them. On Tuesday, our country was attacked with deliberate
and massive cruelty. We have seen the images of fire and ashes and bent steel.Now come
the names, the list of casualties we are only beginning to read:They are the names of men and
women who began their day at a desk or in an airport, busy with life.They are the names
of people who faced death and in
their last moments called home to say, be brave and I love you.They are the names of passengers who defied their murderers and prevented the murder of
others on the ground.They are the names of men and women who wore the uniform of the
United States and died at their posts.They are the names of rescuers -- the ones whom
death found running up the stairs and into the fires to help others.We will read all
these names. We will linger over them and learn their stories, and many Americans will
weep.To the children and parents and spouses and families and friends of the lost, we offer
the deepest sympathy of the nation. And I assure you, you are not alone. Just three days
removed from these events, Americans do not yet have the distance of history, but our
responsibility to history is already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of
evil.War has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is
peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. This conflict was begun on the timing and
terms of others; it will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing. Our purpose as a
nation is firm, yet our wounds as a people are recent and unhealed and lead us to pray. In
many of our prayers this week, there's a searching and an honesty. At St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York, on Tuesday, a woman said, ""I pray to God to give us a sign
that He's still here.""Others have prayed for the same, searching hospital to hospital, carrying pictures of
those still missing. God's signs are not always the ones we look for. We learn in tragedy
that His purposes are not always our own, yet the prayers of private suffering, whether in
our homes or in this great cathedral are known and heard and understood. There are prayers
that help us last through the day or endure the night. There are prayers of friends and
strangers that give us strength for the journey, and there are prayers that yield our will
to a Will greater than our own.This world He created is of moral design. Grief and tragedy and hatred are only for a
time. Goodness, remembrance and love have no end, and the Lord of life holds all who die
and all who mourn.It is said that adversity introduces us to ourselves. This is true of a
nation as well. In this trial, we have been reminded and the world has seen that our
fellow Americans are generous and kind, resourceful and brave.We see our national character in rescuers working past exhaustion, in long lines of
blood donors, in thousands of citizens who have asked to work and serve in any way
possible.And we have seen our national character in eloquent acts of sacrifice:Inside
the World Trade Center, one man who could have saved himself stayed until the end and at
the side of his quadriplegic
friend.A beloved priest died giving the last rites to a firefighter.Two office workers,
finding a disabled stranger, carried her down 68 floors to safety.A group of men drove through the night from Dallas to Washington to bring skin grafts
for burned victims.In these acts and many others, Americans showed a deep commitment to
one another and an abiding love for our country.Today, we feel what Franklin Roosevelt
called, ""the warm courage of national unity."" This is a unity of every faith and
every background. It has joined together political parties and both houses of Congress.
It is evident in services of prayer and candlelight vigils and American flags, which are
displayed in pride and waved in defiance. Our unity is a kinship of grief and a steadfast
resolve to prevail against our enemies. And this unity against terror is now extending
across the world.America is a nation full of good fortune, with so much to be grateful for, but we are
not spared from suffering. In every generation, the world has produced enemies of human
freedom. They have attacked America because we are freedom's home and defender, and the
commitment of our Fathers is now the calling of our time.On this national day of prayer
and remembrance, we ask Almighty God to watch over our nation and grant us patience and
resolve in all that is to come. We pray that He will comfort and console those who now
walk in sorrow. We thank Him for each life we now must mourn, and the promise of a life to
come.As we've been assured, neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities, nor powers
nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth can separate us from God's
love.1May He bless the souls of the departed. May He comfort our own. And may He always
guide our country.God bless America.",middle hour grief many suffer great loss today express nation sorrow come god pray miss dead love tuesday country attack deliberate massive cruelty see image fire ash bend come name list casualty begin read name men woman begin day desk airport busy name people face death last moment call home say brave love name passenger defy murderer prevent murder others name men woman wear uniform unite state die name rescuer one death find run stair fire help read name linger learn story many american child parent spouse family friend lose offer deepest sympathy nation assure alone three day remove event american yet distance history responsibility history already clear answer attack rid world wag u stealth deceit murder nation peaceful fierce stir anger conflict begin time term others end way hour choose purpose nation firm yet wound people recent unhealed lead u pray many prayer week search honesty cathedral new york tuesday woman say pray god give u sign still others pray search hospital hospital carry picture still miss god sign always one look learn tragedy purpose always yet prayer private suffer whether home great cathedral know hear understand prayer help u last day endure night prayer friend stranger give u strength journey prayer yield greater world create moral design grief tragedy hatred time goodness remembrance love end lord life hold die say adversity introduce u true nation well trial remind world see fellow american generous kind resourceful see national character rescuer work past exhaustion long line blood donor thousand citizen ask work serve way see national character eloquent act sacrifice inside world trade center one man could save stay end side quadriplegic beloved priest die give last rite office worker find disable stranger carry floor group men drive night dallas washington bring skin graft burn act many others american show deep commitment one another abide love feel franklin roosevelt call warm courage national unity unity every faith every background join together political party house congress evident service prayer candlelight vigil american flag display pride wave defiance unity kinship grief steadfast resolve prevail enemy unity terror extend across nation full good fortune much grateful spar suffer every generation world produce enemy human freedom attack america freedom home defender commitment father call national day prayer remembrance ask almighty god watch nation grant u patience resolve come pray comfort console walk sorrow thank life must mourn promise life assure neither death life angel principality power thing present thing come height depth separate u bless soul depart may comfort may always guide bless america,hour grief loss today nation sorrow god pray love country attack cruelty see image fire bend list casualty men woman day airport name people death moment call home name passenger defy murderer prevent murder others men woman state die name death find stair fire help name story child parent family friend lose offer nation assure day event history responsibility history attack world wag stealth deceit murder nation fierce stir anger conflict begin time term others way hour nation firm people lead prayer week search york woman pray god sign others hospital hospital carry picture god sign look tragedy purpose suffer home prayer help day night prayer friend stranger strength journey prayer yield world create design grief tragedy time goodness remembrance end lord life hold die adversity nation trial remind world kind character rescuer work exhaustion line blood donor citizen ask work way character eloquent act sacrifice world trade center man side quadriplegic die give office worker stranger floor group men night dallas skin graft others show commitment abide love feel courage unity unity faith background join party house congress service prayer flag display pride defiance unity kinship grief steadfast prevail enemy unity terror nation fortune spar suffer generation world freedom attack america freedom home defender commitment father day prayer remembrance ask watch nation grant patience resolve pray comfort console walk sorrow life life assure death life principality power thing thing depth bless depart bless america
12,15 September 2001,>American Rhetoric: George W. Bush - First Radio Address After 9/,"Good morning. This weekend I 
		am engaged in extensive sessions with members of my National Security 
		Council, as we plan a comprehensive assault on terrorism. This will be a 
		different kind of conflict against a different kind of enemy.This is a conflict without 
		battlefields or beachheads, a conflict with opponents who believe they 
		are invisible. Yet, they are mistaken. They will be exposed, and they 
		will discover what others in the past have learned: Those who make war 
		against the United States have chosen their own destruction. Victory 
		against terrorism will not take place in a single battle, but in a 
		series of decisive actions against terrorist organizations and those who 
		harbor and support them.We are planning a broad and 
		sustained campaign to secure our country and eradicate the evil of 
		terrorism. And we are determined to see this conflict through. Americans 
		of every faith and background are committed to this goal.YesterdayI visited the site 
		of the destructionin New York City and saw an amazing spirit of 
		sacrifice and patriotism and defiance. I met with rescuers who have 
		worked past exhaustion, who cheered for our country and the great cause 
		we have entered.In Washington, D.C., the 
		political parties and both Houses of Congress have shown a remarkable 
		unity, and I'm deeply grateful. A terrorist attack designed to tear us 
		apart has instead bound us together as a nation. Over the past few days, 
		we have learned much about American courage -- the courage of 
		firefighters and police officers who suffered so great a loss, the 
		courage of passengers aboardUnited 93who may well have fought with the 
		hijackers and saved many lives on the ground.Now we honor those who died, 
		and prepare to respond to these attacks on our nation. I will not settle 
		for a token act. Our response must be sweeping, sustained, and 
		effective. We have much do to, and much to ask of the American people.You will be asked for your 
		patience -- for the conflict will not be short. You will be asked for 
		resolve -- for the conflict will not be easy. You will be asked for your 
		strength, because the course to victory may be long.In the past week, we have 
		seen the American people at their very best everywhere in 
		America. Citizens have come together to pray, to give blood, to fly our 
		country's flag. Americans are coming together to share their grief and 
		gain strength from one another.Great tragedy has come to 
		us, and we are meeting it with the best that is in our country, with 
		courage and concern for others: because this is America. This is who we 
		are. This is what our enemies hate and have attacked. And this is why we 
		will prevail.Thank you for listening.",good morning weekend engage extensive session member national security council plan comprehensive assault terrorism different kind conflict different kind conflict without battlefield beachhead conflict opponent believe invisible yet mistake expose discover others past learn make war unite state choose destruction victory terrorism take place single battle series decisive action terrorist organization harbor support plan broad sustain campaign secure country eradicate evil terrorism determine see conflict american every faith background commit visit site destructionin new york city saw amaze spirit sacrifice patriotism defiance meet rescuer work past exhaustion cheer country great cause washington political party house congress show remarkable unity deeply grateful terrorist attack design tear u apart instead bind u together nation past day learn much american courage courage firefighter police officer suffer great loss courage passenger aboardunited may well fight hijacker save many live honor die prepare respond attack nation settle token act response must sweep sustain effective much much ask american ask patience conflict short ask resolve conflict easy ask strength course victory may past week see american people best everywhere america citizen come together pray give blood fly country flag american come together share grief gain strength one tragedy come u meet best country courage concern others america enemy hate attack listen,morning weekend session member security council plan assault terrorism kind conflict kind conflict beachhead conflict opponent discover others war state destruction victory terrorism place battle series action organization harbor support plan sustain campaign country terrorism determine faith background commit site york city spirit sacrifice patriotism defiance meet rescuer work exhaustion cheer country party house congress unity attack design nation day courage courage police officer loss courage passenger hijacker honor die attack nation act response ask patience conflict ask conflict strength course victory week people blood country share gain strength tragedy meet country courage concern others hate attack listen
13,17 September 2001,">The Rhetoric of 9/11: Speech by George W. Bush at the Islamic Center of 
Washington - ""Islam is Peace"" 9-17-","Thank you all very much for your hospitality. We've just had a -- wide-ranging
discussions on -- on the matter at hand.Like the good folks standing with me, the American
people were appalled and outraged at last Tuesday's attacks. And so were Muslims all
across the world. Both Americans and Muslim friends and citizens, tax-paying citizens, and
Muslims in nations were just appalled and could not believe what -- what we saw on our TV screens.These acts of violence against innocents violate the fundamental tenets of the Islamic
faith. And it's important for my fellow Americans to understand that. The English
translation is not as eloquent as the original Arabic, but let me quote from the Koran,
itself: ""In the long run, evil in the extreme will be the end of those who do evil. For
that they rejected the signs of Allah and held them up to ridicule.""1The face of terror is not the true 
faith of Islam. That's not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These 
terrorists don't represent peace. They represent evil and war.When we think of 
Islam we think of a faith that brings comfort to a billion people around the 
world. Billions of people find comfort and solace and peace. And that's made 
brothers and sisters out of every race -- out of every race.America counts 
millions of Muslims amongst our citizens, and Muslims make an incredibly 
valuable contribution to our country. Muslims are doctors, lawyers, law 
professors, members of the military, entrepreneurs, shopkeepers, moms and dads. 
And they need to be treated with respect. In our anger and emotion, our fellow 
Americans must treat each other with respect.Women who cover their heads in this country must feel comfortable going outside their
homes. Moms who wear cover must be not intimidated in America. That's not the America I
know. That's not the America I value.I've been told that some fear to leave; some don't
want to go shopping for their families; some don't want to go about their ordinary daily
routines because, by wearing cover, they're afraid they'll be intimidated.That should not
and that will not stand in
America. Those who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take out their
anger don't represent the best of America, they represent the worst of humankind, and they
should be ashamed of that kind of behavior.Now this is a great country. It's a great country because we share the same values of
respect and dignity and human worth. And it is my honor to be meeting with leaders who
feel just the same way I do. They're outraged. They're sad. They love America just as much
as I
do.And I want to thank you all for giving me a chance to come by.And may God bless us all.Thank you.",thank much hospitality discussion matter good folk stand american people appal outrage last tuesday attack muslim across world american muslim friend citizen citizen muslim nation appal could believe saw tv act violence innocent violate fundamental tenet islamic faith important fellow american understand english translation eloquent original arabic let quote koran long run evil extreme end evil reject sign allah hold ridicule face terror true faith islam islam islam peace terrorist represent peace represent evil think islam think faith bring comfort billion people around world billion people find comfort solace peace make brother sister every race every count million muslim amongst citizen muslim make incredibly valuable contribution country muslim doctor lawyer law professor member military entrepreneur shopkeeper mom dad need treat respect anger emotion fellow american must treat cover head country must feel comfortable go outside home mom wear cover must intimidate america america know america tell fear leave want go shop family want go ordinary daily routine wear cover afraid stand america feel like intimidate fellow citizen take anger represent best america represent worst humankind ashamed kind great country great country share value respect dignity human worth honor meet leader feel way outrage sad love america much want thank give chance come may god bless u,hospitality discussion matter folk people outrage attack muslim world muslim friend nation appal saw tv act violence violate tenet faith understand translation let run end evil sign allah ridicule face terror faith islam peace peace bring comfort people world people solace peace brother sister race count muslim amongst citizen muslim contribution country lawyer law professor member entrepreneur mom dad treat respect anger emotion head country home mom cover america america family wear cover stand intimidate citizen represent america represent humankind kind country country share value respect dignity honor meet leader way love chance come bless u

audio.]Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Tempore, members of 
Congress, and fellow Americans:In the normal course of events, Presidents come to this 
chamber to report on the state of the Union. Tonight, no such report is 
needed. It has already been delivered by the American people.We have seen it in the courage of passengers, who rushed 
terrorists to save others on the ground -- passengers like an exceptional man 
named Todd Beamer. And would you please help me to welcome his wife, Lisa 
Beamer, here tonight. We have seen the state of our Union in the endurance 
of rescuers, working past exhaustion. We've seen the unfurling of flags, 
the lighting of candles, the giving of blood, the saying of prayers -- in 
English, Hebrew, and Arabic. We have seen the decency of a loving and 
giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own. My fellow 
citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen for itself the state 
of our Union -- and it is strong.Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend
freedom. Our grief has turned to anger, and anger to resolution. Whether we
bring our enemies to justice, or bring justice to our enemies,justice will be done. I thank the Congress for its leadership at such an important time. All of America
was touched on the evening of the tragedy to see Republicans and Democrats joined together
on the steps of this Capitol, singing ""God Bless America."" And you did
more than sing; you acted, by delivering 40 billion dollars
to rebuild our communities and meet
the needs of our military. Speaker Hastert, Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority Leader
Daschle, and Senator Lott, I thank you for your friendship, for your leadership, and for
your service to our country. And on behalf of the American people, I thank the world
for its outpouring of support. America will never forget the sounds of our National
Anthem playing at Buckingham Palace, on the streets of Paris, and at Berlin's Brandenburg
Gate.We will not forget South Korean children gathering to pray 
outside our embassy in Seoul, or the prayers of sympathy offered at a mosque in 
Cairo. We will not forget moments of silence and days of mourning in 
Australia and Africa and Latin America. Nor will we forget the citizens of 80 
other nations who died with our own: dozens of Pakistanis; more than 130 
Israelis; more than 250 citizens of India; men and women from El Salvador, Iran, 
Mexico, and Japan; and hundreds of British citizens. America has no truer 
friend than Great Britain. Once again, we are joined together in a great 
cause -- so honored the British Prime Minister has crossed an ocean to show his 
unity  with America. Thank you for coming, friend.On September the 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war
against our country. Americans have known wars -- but for the past 136 years, they
have been wars on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941. Americans have known
the casualties of war -- but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful
morning. Americans have known surprise attacks -- but never before on thousands of
civilians. All of this was brought upon us in a single day -- and night fell on a
different world, a world where freedom itself is under attack. Americans have many
questions tonight. Americans are asking: Who attacked our country? The
evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist
organizations known as al Qaeda. They are some of the murderers indicted for bombing
American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and responsible for bombing the USS Cole. Al
Qaeda is to terror what the mafia is to crime. But its goal is not making money; its
goal is remaking the world -- and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere.The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has
been rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics, a fringe
movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam. The terrorists' directive
commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans, and make no distinctions
among military and civilians, including women and children. This group and its leader -- a
person named Usama bin Laden -- are linked to many other organizations in different
countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of
Uzbekistan. There are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries. They are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought to camps in places
like Afghanistan, where they are trained in the tactics of terror. They are sent
back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and
destruction.The leadership of al Qaeda has great influence in Afghanistan and
supports the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country. In Afghanistan, we
see al Qaeda's vision for the world. Afghanistan's people have been brutalized; many are
starving and many have fled. Women are not allowed to attend school. You can
be jailed for owning a television. Religion can be practiced only as their leaders
dictate. A man can be jailed in Afghanistan if his beard is not long enough.The United States respects the people of Afghanistan. After all,
we are currently its largest source of humanitarian aid; but we condemn the Taliban
regime. It is not only repressing its own people, it is threatening people
everywhere by sponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists. By aiding and
abetting murder, the Taliban regime is committing murder.And tonight, the United States of America makes the following
demands on the Taliban: Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of al
Qaeda who hide in your land. Release all foreign nationals, including American
citizens, you have unjustly imprisoned. Protect foreign journalists, diplomats, and
aid workers in your country. Close immediately and permanently every terrorist
training camp in Afghanistan, and hand over every terrorist, and every person in their
support structure, to appropriate authorities. Give the United States full access to
terrorist training camps, so we can make sure they are no longer operating. These demands
are not open to negotiation or discussion. The Taliban must act, and act
immediately. They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate.I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims 
throughout the world. We respect your faith. It's practiced freely 
by many millions of Americans, and by millions more in countries that America 
counts as friends. Its teachings are good and peaceful, and those who 
commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah. The 
terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack Islam 
itself. The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our 
many Arab friends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists, and every 
government that supports them. Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but 
it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of 
global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated.Americans are asking, why do they hate us? They hate what 
they
see right here in this chamber -- a democratically elected government. Their leaders
are self-appointed. They hate our freedoms -- our freedom of religion, our freedom
of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other. They want to
overthrow existing governments in many Muslim countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and
Jordan. They want to drive Israel out of the Middle East. They want to drive
Christians and Jews out of vast regions of Asia and Africa. These terrorists kill not
merely to end lives, but to disrupt and end a way of life. With every atrocity, they
hope that America grows fearful, retreating from the world and forsaking our
friends. They stand against us, because we stand in their way.We are not deceived by their pretenses to piety. We have seen
their kind before. They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th
century. By sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions -- by abandoning
every value except the will to power -- they follow in the path of fascism,  Nazism,
and totalitarianism. And they will follow that path all the way, to where it
ends: in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies. Americans are
asking: How will we fight and win this war? We will direct every
resource at our command -- every means of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every
instrument of law enforcement, every financial influence, and every necessary weapon of
war -- to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network.Now this war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago, with a
decisive liberation of territory and a swift conclusion. It will not look like the
air war above Kosovo two years ago, where no ground troops were used and not a single
American was lost in combat. Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and
isolated strikes. Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign,
unlike any other we have ever seen. It may include dramatic strikes, visible on TV,
and covert operations, secret even in success. We will starve terrorists of funding,
turn them one against another, drive them from place to place, until there is no refuge or
no rest. And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to
terrorism. Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are
with us, or you are with the terrorists. From this day forward, any nation that
continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a
hostile regime.Our nation has been put on notice: We're not immune from
attack. We will take defensive measures against terrorism to protect
Americans. Today, dozens of federal departments and agencies, as well as state and
local governments, have responsibilities affecting homeland security. These efforts
must be coordinated at the highest level. So tonight, I announce the creation of a
Cabinet-level position reporting directly to me -- the Office of Homeland Security. And
tonight I also announce a distinguished American to lead this effort, to strengthen
American security: a military veteran, an effective governor, a true patriot, a trusted
friend -- Pennsylvania's Tom Ridge. He will lead, oversee, and coordinate a
comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism, and respond to
any attacks that may come.These measures are essential. But the only way to defeat
terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where
it grows. Many will be involved in this effort, from FBI agents to intelligence
operatives to the reservists we have called to active duty. All deserve our thanks,
and all have our prayers. And tonight, a few miles from the damaged Pentagon, I have
a message for our military: Be ready. I've called the Armed Forces to alert,
and there is a reason. The hour is coming when America will act, and you will make
us proud. This is not, however, just America's fight. And what is at stake is
not just America's freedom. This is the world's fight. This is civilization's
fight. This is the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and
freedom.We ask every nation to join us. We will ask, and we 
will need, the help of police forces, intelligence services, and banking systems 
around the world. The United States is grateful that many nations and many 
international organizations have already responded -- with sympathy and with 
support. Nations from Latin America, to Asia, to Africa, to Europe, to the 
Islamic world. Perhaps the NATO Charter reflects best the attitude of the 
world: An attack on one is an attack on all. The civilized world is 
rallying to America's side. They understand that if this terror goes 
unpunished, their own cities, their own citizens may be next. Terror, 
unanswered, can not only bring down buildings, it can threaten the stability of 
legitimate governments. And you know what? We're not going to allow it.Americans are asking: What is expected of us? I ask you
to live your lives, and hug your children. I know many citizens have fears tonight,
and I ask you to be calm and resolute, even in the face of a continuing threat. I ask you
to uphold the values of America, and remember why so many have come here. We are in
a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is to live by them. No one
should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words because of their ethnic
background or religious faith. I ask you to continue to support the victims of this
tragedy with your contributions. Those who want to give can go to a central source
of information, libertyunites.org, to find the names of groups providing direct help in
New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.The thousands of FBI agents who are now at work in this
investigation may need your cooperation, and I ask you to give it. I ask for your
patience, with the delays and inconveniences that may accompany tighter security; and for
your patience in what will be a long struggle. I ask your continued participation and
confidence in the American economy. Terrorists attacked a symbol of American
prosperity. They did not touch its source. America is successful because of
the hard work, and creativity, and enterprise of our people. These were the true
strengths of our economy before September 11th, and they are our strengths today. And,
finally, please continue praying for the victims of terror and their families, for those
in uniform, and for our great country. Prayer has comforted us in sorrow, and will
help strengthen us for the journey ahead.Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done
and for what you will do. And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, I thank you,
their representatives, for what you have already done and for what we will do together.
Tonight, we face new and sudden national challenges. We will come together to
improve air safety, to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on domestic flights,
and take new measures to prevent hijacking. We will come together to promote
stability and keep our airlines flying, with direct assistance during this
emergency. We will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it
needs to track down terror here at home. We will come together to strengthen our
intelligence capabilities to know the plans of terrorists before they act, and 
to find them
before they strike.We will come together to take active steps that strengthen 
America's economy, and put our people back to work. Tonight we welcome two 
leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all New Yorkers: Governor 
George Pataki, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. As a symbol of America's 
resolve, my administration will work with Congress, and these two leaders, to 
show the world that we will rebuild New York City.After all that has just passed -- all the lives taken, and 
all the possibilities and hopes that died with them -- it is natural to wonder 
if America's future is one of fear.  Some speak of an age of terror. I know there are struggles ahead, and dangers to face. But this country 
will define our times, not be defined by them. As long as the United 
States of America is determined and strong, this will not be an age of terror; 
this will be an age of liberty, here and across the world.Great harm has been done to us. We have suffered 
great loss. And in our grief and anger we have found our mission and our 
moment. Freedom and fear are at war.  The advance of human freedom -- 
the great achievement of our time, and the great hope of every time -- now 
depends on us. Our nation, this generation will lift a dark threat of 
violence from our people and our future. We will rally the world to this 
cause by our efforts, by our courage. We will not tire, we will not 
falter, and we will not fail.It is my hope that in the months and years ahead, life will return
almost to normal.  We'll go back to our lives and routines, and that is good. 
Even grief recedes with time and grace. But our resolve must not pass. Each of
us will remember what happened that day, and to whom it happened. We'll remember the
moment the news came -- where we were and what we were doing. Some will remember an
image of a fire, or a story of rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a
voice gone forever.And I will carry this: It is the police shield of a 
man named George Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save 
others. It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her 
son. It is my reminder of lives that ended, and a task that does not 
end. I will not forget this wound to our country or those who inflicted 
it. I will not yield; I will not rest; I will not relent in waging this 
struggle for freedom and security for the American people. The course of this 
conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. Freedom and fear, 
justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and we know that God is not 
neutral between them.Fellow citizens, we'll meet violence with patient justice -- assured
of the rightness of our cause, and confident of the victories to come. In all that
lies before us, may God grant us wisdom, and may He watch over the United States of
America.Thank you.",george bush address joint session congress american people joint session congress follow attacksdelivered september addressyour browser support audio pdf authenticity certify text

15,07 October 2001,>The Rhetoric of 9/11 - President Bush delivers Operation Enduring Freedom Address to the Nation (10-07-0,"Good afternoon. On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes against Al
Qaeda terrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime in
Afghanistan. These carefully targeted actions are designed to disrupt the use of
Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations and to attack the military capability of the
Taliban regime.We are joined in this operation by our staunch friend, Great Britain.
Other close friends, including Canada, Australia, Germany and France, have pledged forces
as the operation unfolds. More than 40 countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and
across Asia have granted air transit or landing rights. Many more have shared
intelligence. We are supported by the collective will of the world.More than two weeks ago, I gave Taliban leaders a series of clear and specific demands: Close terrorist training camps; hand over leaders of the Al Qaeda network;
and return all foreign nationals, including American citizens, unjustly detained in your country. None of
these demands was met. And now, the Taliban will pay a price.By destroying camps and
disrupting communications, we will make it more difficult for the terror network to train
new recruits and coordinate their evil plans. Initially the terrorists may burrow deeper
into caves and other entrenched hiding places. Our military action is also designed to
clear the way for sustained, comprehensive, and relentless operations to drive them out and
bring them to justice.At the same time, the oppressed people of Afghanistan will know the generosity of
America and our allies. As we strike military targets, we will also drop food, medicine,
and supplies to the starving and suffering men and women and children of Afghanistan. The
United States of America is a friend to the Afghan people, and we are the friends of
almost a billion worldwide who practice the Islamic faith. The United States of America is
an enemy of those who aid terrorists and of the barbaric criminals who profane a great
religion by committing murder in its name. This military action is a part of our campaign
against terrorism, another front in a war that has already been joined through diplomacy,
intelligence, the freezing of financial assets, and the arrests of known terrorists by
law-enforcement agents in 38 countries.Given the nature and reach of our enemies, we will win this conflict by the patient
accumulation of successes, by meeting a series of challenges with determination, and will,
and purpose. Today we focus on Afghanistan, but the battle is broader. Every nation has a
choice to make. In this conflict, there is no neutral ground. If any government sponsors
the outlaws and killers of innocence, they have become outlaws and murderers themselves.
And they will take that lonely path at their own peril.I'm speaking to you today from the
Treaty Room of the White House, a place where American presidents have worked for peace.
We're a peaceful nation. Yet, as we have learned, so suddenly and so tragically, there can
be no peace in a world of sudden terror. In the face of today's new threat, the only way
to pursue peace is to pursue those who threaten it. We did not ask for this mission, but
we will fulfill it.The name of today's military operation isEnduring Freedom. We defend not only our
precious freedoms, but also the freedom of people everywhere to live and raise their
children free from fear.I know many Americans feel fear today. And our government is
taking strong precautions. All law enforcement and intelligence agencies are working
aggressively around America, around the world -- and around the clock. At my request, many
governors have activated the National Guard to strengthen airport security. We have called
up reserves to reinforce our military capability and strengthen the protection of our
homeland.In the months ahead, our patience will be one of our strengths -- patience with the
long waits that will result from tighter security, patience and understanding that it will
take time to achieve our goals, patience in all the sacrifices that may come. Today, those
sacrifices are being made by members of our armed forces who now defend us so far from
home, and by their proud and worried families.A Commander-in-Chief sends America's sons
and daughters into battle in a foreign land only after the greatest care and a lot of
prayer. We ask a lot of those who wear our uniform. We ask them to leave their loved ones,
to travel great distances, to risk injury, even to be prepared to make the ultimate
sacrifice of their lives. They are dedicated. They are honorable. They represent the best
of our country, and we are grateful. To all the men and women in our military -- every
sailor, every soldier, every airman, every Coast Guardsman, every Marine -- I say this:
Your mission is defined; your objectives are clear; your goal is just. You have my full
confidence, and you will have every tool you need to carry out your duty.I recently received a touching letter that says a lot about the state of America in
these difficult times, a letter from a fourth-grade girl with a father in the military: 
""As much as I don't want my dad to fight,"" she wrote, ""I'm willing to give
him to you."" This is a precious gift. The greatest she could give. This young girl
knows what America is all about. Since September 11, an entire generation of young
Americans has gained new understanding of the value of freedom and its cost and duty and
its sacrifice.The battle is now joined on many fronts. We will not waiver, we will not
tire, we will not falter, and we will not fail. Peace and freedom will prevail.Thank you. May God continue to bless America.",good afternoon order unite state military begin strike al qaeda terrorist train camp military installation taliban regime afghanistan carefully target action design

16,11 October 2001,>George W. Bush - 9/11 Pentagon Memorial Speech 20,"Please be seated.  President and Senator Clinton, thank you all for 
		being here.  We have comehereto pay our respects to 125 men and women 
		who died in the service of America.  We also remember 64 passengers on ahijacked plane; those men and women, boys and girls who fell into the 
		hands of evildoers, and also died here exactly one month ago.OnSeptember 11th, great sorrow came to our country.  And from that 
		sorrow has come great resolve.  Today, we are a nation awakened to the 
		evil of terrorism, and determined to destroy it.  That work began the 
		moment we were attacked; and it will continue until justice is 
		delivered.Americans are returning, as we must, to the normal pursuits of life.  Americans are returning, as we must, to the normal pursuits of 
		life.  But we know that if you lost a son or daughter here, or a 
		husband, or a wife, or a mom or dad, life will never again be as it 
		was.  The loss was sudden, and hard, and permanent.  So difficult to 
		explain.  So difficult to accept.Three schoolchildren traveling with their teacher.  An Army general. A 
		budget analyst who reported to work here for 30 years.  A lieutenant 
		commander in the Naval Reserve who left behind a wife, a four-year-old 
		son, and another child on the way.One life touches so many others.  One death can leave sorrow that seems 
		almost unbearable.  But to all of you who lost someone here, I want to 
		say:  You are not alone.  The American people will never forget the 
		cruelty that was done here and in New York, and in the sky over 
		Pennsylvania.We will never forget all the innocent people killed by the hatred of a 
		few.  We know the loneliness you feel in your loss.  The entire nation, 
		the entire nation shares in your sadness.  And we pray for you and your 
		loved ones.  And we will always honor their memory.The hijackers were instruments of evil who died in vain.  Behind them is 
		a cult of evil which seeks to harm the innocent and thrives on human 
		suffering.  Theirs is the worst kind of cruelty, the cruelty that is 
		fed, not weakened, by tears.  Theirs is the worst kind of violence, pure 
		malice, while daring to claim the authority of God.  We cannot fully 
		understand the designs and power of evil.  It is enough to know that 
		evil, like goodness, exists.  And in the terrorists, evil has found a 
		willing servant.In New York, the terrorists chose as their target a symbol of America's 
		freedom and confidence.  Here, they struck a symbol of our strength in 
		the world.  And the attack on the Pentagon, on that day, was more 
		symbolic than they knew.  It was on another September 11th -- September 
		11th, 1941 -- that construction on this building first began. America 
		was just then awakening to another menace:  The Nazi terror in Europe.And on that very night,President Franklin Roosevelt spoketo the 
		nation.  ""The danger,"" he warned, ""has long ceased to be a mere 
		possibility. The danger is here now -- not only from a military enemy, 
		but from an enemy of all law, all liberty, all morality, all religion.""1For us too, in the year 2001, an enemy has emerged that rejects every 
		limit of law, morality, and religion.  The terrorists have no true home 
		in any country, or culture, or faith.  They dwell in dark corners of 
		earth. And there, we will find them.This week, I have called -- This week, I have called the 
		Armed Forces into action.  One by one, we are eliminating power centers 
		of a regime that harbors al Qaeda terrorists.  We gave that regime a 
		choice: Turn over the terrorists, or face your ruin.  They chose 
		unwisely.The Taliban regime has brought nothing but fear and misery to the people 
		of Afghanistan.  These rulers call themselves holy men, even with their 
		record of drawing money from heroin trafficking.  They consider 
		themselves pious and devout, while subjecting women to fierce brutality.The Taliban has allied itself with murderers and gave them shelter. But 
		today, for al Qaeda and the Taliban, there is no shelter.  As Americans did 60 years ago, we have entered a struggle of uncertain 
		duration.  But now, as then, we can be certain of the outcome, because 
		we have a number of decisive assets.We have a unified country.  We have the patience to fight and win on 
		many fronts:  Blocking terrorist plans, seizing their funds, arresting 
		their networks, disrupting their communications, opposing their 
		sponsors. And we have one more great asset in this cause:  The brave men 
		and women of the United States military.From my first days in this office, I have felt and seen the strong 
		spirit of the Armed Forces.I saw it atFort Stewart, Georgia, when I 
		first reviewed our troops as Commander-in-Chief, and looked into the 
		faces of proud and determined soldiers.I saw it in Annapolis on a 
		graduation day;at Camp Pendleton in California;Camp Bondsteel in 
		Kosovo.And I have seen this spirit at the Pentagon, before and after 
		the attack on this building.You've responded to a great emergency with calm and courage.  And for 
		that, your country honors you.  A Commander-in-Chief must know 
		--mustknow -- that he can count on the skill and readiness of servicemen and 
		women at every point in the chain of command.  You have given me that 
		confidence.And I give you these commitments.  The wound to this building will not 
		be forgotten, but it will be repaired.  Brick by brick, we will quickly 
		rebuild the Pentagon.  In the missions ahead for the 
		military, you will have everything you need, every resource, every 
		weapon, every means to assure full victory for the 
		United States and the cause of freedom.And I pledge to you that America will never relent on this war against 
		terror.  There will be times of swift, dramatic 
		action.  There will be times of steady, quiet progress.  Over time, with 
		patience, and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.  They will be 
		isolated, surrounded, cornered, until there is no place to run, or hide, 
		or rest.As military and civilian personnel in the Pentagon, you are an important 
		part of the struggle we have entered.  You know the risks of your 
		calling, and you have willingly accepted them.  You believe in our 
		country, and our country believes in you.Within sight of this building isArlington [National] Cemetery, the final resting 
		place of many thousands who died for our country over the generations. 
		Enemies of America have now added to these graves, and they wish to add 
		more.  Unlike our enemies, we value every life, and we mourn every loss.Yet we're not afraid.  Our cause is just, and worthy of sacrifice. Our 
		nation is strong of heart, firm of purpose.  Inspired by all the courage 
		that has come before, we will meet our moment and we will prevail.May God bless you all, and may God bless America.",please seat president senator clinton thank comehereto pay respect men woman die

October 2001, White House, Washington, D.C.Your  browser does not support the video tag.Audio mp3 of AddressYour browser does not support the audio element.click 
for pdfGood evening.  I would like to report to the 
		American people on the state of our war against terror, and then 
		I'll be happy to take questions from the White House press corps.One month ago today, innocent citizens from more than 80 nations 
		were attacked and killed, without warning or provocation, in an act that 
		horrified not only every American, but every person of every faith, and 
		every nation that values human life.The attack took place on American soil, but it was an attack on the 
		heart and soul of the civilized world.  And the world has come together 
		to fight a new and different war, the first, and we hope the only one, 
		of the 21st century.  A war against all those who seek to export terror, 
		and a war against those governments that support or shelter them.We've accomplished a great deal in one month.  Our staunch friends, 
		Great Britain, our neighbors Canada and Mexico, our NATO allies, our 
		allies in Asia, Russia and nations from every continent on the Earth 
		have offered help of one kind or another -- from military assistance to 
		intelligence information, to crack down on terrorists' financial 
		networks.  This week, 56 Islamic nations issued a statement strongly 
		condemning the savage acts of terror, and emphasizing that those acts 
		contradict the peaceful teachings of Islam.All is strong and united on the diplomatic front.  The men 
		and women of the United States military are doing their duty with skill 
		and success. We have ruined terrorist training camps, disrupted their 
		communications, weakened the Taliban military, and destroyed most of 
		their air defenses.We're mounting a sustained campaign to drive the terrorists out of 
		their hidden caves and to bring them to justice.  All missions are being 
		executed according to plan on the military front.  At the same time, we 
		are showing the compassion of America by delivering food and medicine to 
		the Afghan people who are, themselves, the victims of a repressive 
		regime.On the law enforcement front, terrorists are being swept up 
		in an international dragnet.  Several hundred have been 
		arrested.  Thousands of FBI agents are on the trail of other suspects 
		here and abroad.  Working with countries around the world, we have 
		frozen more than $24 million in al Qaeda or Taliban assets.We are aggressively pursuing the agents of terror around the world, 
		and we are aggressively strengthening our protections here at 
		home.  This week we established America's newOffice of Homeland 
		Security, directed by former Governor Tom Ridge.  Americans tonight 
		can know that while the threat is ongoing, we are taking every possible 
		step to protect our country from danger.Your government is doing everything we can to recover from these 
		attacks, and to try to prevent others.  We're acting to make planes and 
		airports safer, rebuild New York and the Pentagon.  We must act to 
		stimulate a slow economy, to help laid-off workers.  And we must fund 
		our military.This is a time of testing -- this time of testing has revealed the 
		true character of the American people.  We're angry at the evil that was 
		done to us, yet patient and just in our response.Before September 11th, my Administration was planning an initiative 
		calledCommunities of Character.  It was designed to help parents 
		develop good character in our children, and to strengthen a spirit of 
		citizenship and service in our communities.  The acts of September 11th 
		have prompted that initiative to occur on its own, in ways far greater 
		than I could have ever imagined.  We've shown great love for our 
		country, and great tolerance and respect for all our countrymen.I was struck by this:  that in many cities, when Christian and 
		Jewish women learn that Muslim women -- women of cover -- were afraid of 
		going out of their homes alone, that they went shopping with them, that 
		they showed true friendship and support -- an act that shows the world 
		the true nature of America.Our war on terrorism has nothing to do with differences in 
		faith.  It has everything to do with people of all faiths coming 
		together to condemn hate and evil and murder and prejudice.One month after great suffering and sorrow, America is strong and 
		determined and generous.  I'm honored to lead such a country, and I know 
		we are ready for the challenges ahead.And, now, I welcome your questions.Ron.Question:Thank you, sir.  You said that the threat is ongoing, and, 
		indeed, the deadly virus of anthrax was found in three Florida people 
		this week.  Osama bin Laden's spokesman says storms of planes are yet to 
		be hijacked.  Your FBI warned just today that terrorist attacks could be 
		happening again in the next couple of days.If the FBI knows of a credible threat, can you assure the public 
		that you would take the precaution of locking down any system involved, 
		whether it's buildings, airports, water systems, to prevent more 
		deaths?  And, most importantly, is there anything you can say to 
		Americans who feel helpless to protect themselves and their families 
		from the next wave of attacks, if there are more to come?  What can 
		people do to protect themselves?President Bush:Sure.  Today, the Justice Department did 
		issue a blanket alert.  It was in recognition of a general threat 
		we received. This is not the first time the Justice Department have 
		acted like this.  I hope it's the last.  But, given the attitude of the 
		evildoers, it may not be.I have urged our fellow Americans to go about their lives, to fly 
		on airplanes, to travel, to go to work.  But I also want to encourage 
		them by telling them that our government is on full alert.  And that -- 
		the alert put out today from the Justice Department was such an action.Now, if we receive specific intelligence, where we -- a credible 
		threat that targets a specific building or city or facility, I can 
		assure you our government will do everything possible to protect the 
		citizens around and in, or near that facility.And let me give you one example of a specific threat we 
		received.  You may remember recently there was a lot of discussion about 
		crop dusters.  We received knowledge that perhaps an al Qaeda operative 
		was prepared to use a crop duster to spray a biological weapon or 
		a chemical weapon on American people.  And so we responded.  We 
		contacted every crop-dust location, airports from which crop dusters 
		leave, we notified crop duster manufactures to a potential threat.  We 
		knew full well that in order for a crop duster to become a weapon of 
		mass destruction would require a retrofitting, and so we talked to 
		machine shops around where crop dusters are located.  We took strong and 
		appropriate action.  And we will do so any time we receive a credible 
		threat.Now, the American people have got to go about their business.  We 
		cannot let the terrorists achieve the objective of frightening our 
		nation to the point where we don't -- where we don't conduct business, 
		where people don't shop.  That's their intention.  Their intention was 
		not only to kill and maim and destroy.  Their intention was to frighten 
		to the point where our nation would not act.  Their intention was to so 
		frighten our government that we wouldn't seek justice; that somehow we 
		would cower in the face of their threats and not respond, abroad or at 
		home.We're both responding abroad and at home.  The American people, 
		obviously, if they see something that is suspicious, something out of 
		the norm that looks suspicious, they ought to notify local law 
		authorities. But in the meantime, they ought to take comfort in knowing 
		our government is doing everything we possibly can.We've got a Homeland Security Office now running, as I mentioned, 
		headed by Tom Ridge.  We're sharing intelligence with our friends in 
		countries from overseas.  We follow every lead.  And information-sharing 
		between the CIA and the FBI is seamless, so that the reaction to any 
		threat is real-time.  And -- but the truth of the matter is, in order to 
		fully defend America, we must defeat the evildoers where they 
		hide.  We must round them up, and we must bring them to justice.  And 
		that's exactly what we're doing in Afghanistan -- the first battle in 
		the war of the 21st century.Steve.Question:Thank you.  You've been careful to avoid saying how long the 
		military strikes in Afghanistan might take place.  But can you promise 
		to say how long American -- can you avoid being drawn into a 
		Vietnam-like quagmire in Afghanistan?President Bush:We learned some very important lessons in 
		Vietnam. Perhaps the most important lesson that I learned is that 
		you cannot fight a guerrilla war with conventional forces.  That's why 
		I've explained to the American people that we're engaged in a different 
		type of war; one obviously that will use conventional forces, but one in 
		which we've got to fight on all fronts.I remember saying to you all that the first shot in the war was 
		when we started cutting off their money, because an al Qaeda 
		organization can't function without money.  And we're continuing our 
		efforts to reach out to willing nations to disrupt and seize assets of 
		the al Qaeda organization.We are in the process of rounding up al Qaeda members around 
		the world.  There are al Qaeda organizations in, roughly, 68 
		countries.  And over 200 have now been apprehended.  And every 
		time I talk to a world leader, I urge them to continue finding the al 
		Qaeda representatives and bring them to justice.As far as the use of conventional forces, we've got a clear 
		plan, and it's to say to the host government that you have been given 
		your -- and by the way, I gave them ample opportunity to turn over al 
		Qaeda.  I made it very clear to them, in no uncertain terms, that in 
		order to avoid punishment, they should turn over the parasites that hide 
		in their country. They obviously refused to do so.  And now they're 
		paying a price.  We are dismantling their military, disrupting their 
		communications, severing their ability to defend themselves.  And 
		slowly, but surely, we're smoking al Qaeda out of their caves so we can 
		bring them to justice.People often ask me, how long will this last?  This 
		particular battlefront will last as long as it takes to bring al Qaeda 
		to justice.  It may happen tomorrow; it may happen a month from now; it 
		may take a year or two.  But we will prevail.  And what the American 
		people need to know is what our allies know:  I am determined to stay 
		the course.  And we must do so.  We must do so.  We must rid the world 
		of terrorists so our children and grandchildren can grow up in 
		freedom.  It is essential.  It is now our time to act.  And I'm proud to 
		lead a country that understands that.Question:Mr. President, today, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld said that
		Osama bin Laden was probably still in Afghanistan.  How can 
		the U.S. get him, dead or alive -- to use words that you've used 
		recently -- if we're not entirely sure whether he's in the country?  And 
		can we win the war on terrorism if bin Laden is not found?President Bush:Ours is a war against terrorism in general.  Mr. 
		bin Laden is a -- is one of the worst.  But as you may remember, we 
		published the 22 Most Wanted; he's one of 22 we're after.  In terms of 
		Mr. bin Laden himself, we'll get him running.  We'll smoke him out of 
		his cave, and we'll get him eventually.But success or failure depends not on bin Laden; success or 
		failure depends upon routing out terrorism where it may exist all 
		around the world. He's just one person, a part of a network.  And we're 
		slowly, but surely, with determined fashion, routing that network out 
		and bringing it to justice.We've been active for a month.  I intend to be giving you a 
		briefing for as long as I'm the President.  I understand this is a 
		unconventional war.  It's a different kind of war.  It's not the kind of 
		war that we're used to in America.  TheGreatest Generationwas 
		used to storming beachheads.Baby boomerssuch as myself, were 
		used to getting caught in a quagmire of Vietnam where politics made 
		decisions more than the military sometimes.Generation Xwas 
		able to watch technology right in front of their TV screens -- you know, 
		burrow into concrete bunkers in Iraq and blow them up.  This is a 
		different kind of war that requires a different type of approach and a 
		different type of mentality.And so we're going to slowly, but surely, tighten the net on 
		terrorists, wherever they live.  And it's essential to do so now.  It's 
		essential to do so now.  The actions my government takes, in concert 
		with other countries, the actions we take at home to defend ourselves 
		will serve as a go-by for future Presidents, or future prime ministers 
		in Britain, for example, or future FBI directors.  It is important that 
		we stay the course, bring these people to justice, to show -- and show 
		others how to fight the new wars of the 21st century.Helen.Question:Mr. President, on that note, we understand you have advisors 
		who are urging you to go after Iraq, take out Iraq, Syria and so 
		forth.  Do you really think that the American people will tolerate you widening the war beyond Afghanistan?  And I have a 
		follow-up.President Bush:Thank you for warning me.Our focus is on Afghanistan, and the terrorist network hiding in 
		Afghanistan, right now.  But, as well, we're looking for al Qaeda cells 
		around the world.  If we find an al Qaeda cell operating, we will urge 
		the host country to bring them to justice.  And we're having some 
		progress, we're making progress.We -- as I mentioned, Helen, this is a long war against terrorist 
		activity.  And the doctrine I spelled out to the American people in 
		front of Congress said not only will we seek out and bring to justice 
		individual terrorists who cause harm to people, to murder people, we 
		will also bring to justice the host governments that sponsor them, that 
		house them and feed them.You mentioned Iraq.  There's no question that the leader of 
		Iraq is an evil man.  After all, he gassed his own people.  We know he's 
		been developing weapons of mass destruction.  And I think it's in his 
		advantage to allow inspectors back in his country to make sure that he's 
		conforming to the agreement he made, after he was soundly trounced in 
		the Gulf War. And so we're watching him very carefully.  We're watching 
		him carefully.Your follow-up, please.Question:It's a little offbeat, but --President Bush:Okay.  Well, I expect an offbeat question, frankly.Question:-- you've met twice in the White House since you've been in 
		office with Prime Minister Sharon.  But you have refused to meet with 
		Yasser Arafat.  Now that you envision a Palestinian state, will you meet 
		with Arafat and, if so, when?President Bush:I want to assure the American people, in particular 
		our allies who are interested in our position in the Middle East, 
		that we're spending a lot of time dealing with the Middle East.  I know 
		there was some concern amongst our allies when the September 11th -- 
		right after the September 11th attack, that we would forego any 
		responsibility we have in the Middle East.  Secretary of State Powell is 
		doing a great job of staying in contact with both Mr. Arafat and Prime 
		Minister Sharon.I have met with Prime Minister Sharon, and I've assured him every 
		time we've met that he has no better friend than the United States of 
		America. I also stated the other day that if we ever get into the 
		Mitchell process where we can start discussing a political solution in 
		the Middle East, that I believe there ought to be a Palestinian state, 
		the boundaries of which will be negotiated by the parties, so long as 
		the Palestinian state recognizes the right of Israel to exist and will 
		treat Israel with respect, and will be peaceful on her borders.Obviously, the events of September 11th have prevented overt 
		diplomacy in the Middle East -- not prevented it, it just made it -- my 
		calendar is a little crowded.  On the other hand, I am very much 
		engaged.  I have spoken to Prime Minister Sharon again.  And if I am 
		convinced that a meeting with a particular party at this point in time 
		will further the process, I will do so.  If it turns out to be an empty 
		photo opportunity that creates expectations that will become dashed, I 
		won't meet.I hope progress is being made.  I was pleased to see that Mr. 
		Arafat is trying to control the radical elements within the Palestinian 
		Authority. And I think the world ought to applaud him for that.  I hope 
		he's taking measures necessary to reduce the violence in the Middle 
		East, so that we can get into the Mitchell process.We're working hard on the topic, Helen.  It's a very important part 
		of our foreign policy.David.Question:Mr. President, good evening.  I'd like to ask you for a more 
		complete portrait of your progress so far.  Can you tell the American 
		people, specifically, what is the state of Osama bin Laden?  What 
		is the state of the al Qaeda network?  Are they on the run?  To 
		what extent have you been able to disrupt their activities?  Do you 
		believe there are members of those cells still in the United States 
		capable of carrying out terrorist acts?  And, again, do you know whether 
		Osama bin Laden is dead or alive?President Bush:Let me start backwards.  I don't know if he's dead 
		or alive.  I want him brought to justice, however.  We are following 
		every possible lead to make sure that any al Qaeda member that could be 
		in the United States is brought to justice.  The FBI has got thousands 
		of agents who are following every hint of a possibility of an al Qaeda 
		in our country.  We're chasing down the leads of -- that have been given 
		to us as a result of the bombing.  And we're following other leads.Let me say one thing about the FBI that I think people find 
		interesting.  All of us in government are having to adjust our way of 
		thinking about the new war.  The military is going to have to 
		adjust.  They recognize -- and Secretary Rumsfeld clearly understands 
		this -- that we need to have a -- that we need to rethink how we 
		configure our military -- there's been some stories to that effect -- so 
		that we can more effectively respond to asymmetrical responses from 
		terrorist organizations.  The FBI must think differently, and 
		Director Mueller is causing them to do so.The FBI, as you know, spent a lot of manpower and time chasing -- 
		spies in a post-Cold War era.  They were still chasing spies.  Nothing 
		wrong with that, except we have a new enemy.  And now, the FBI is 
		rightly directing resources toward homeland security.  It's been an 
		adjustment. And I'm proud to report that Director Mueller has adjusted 
		quickly.I am confident that the al Qaeda organization is moving around 
		Afghanistan.  They think they might find safe haven.  Not if we 
		think they're there.  And we've got them on the run.The other day, we brought to justice a person that killed an 
		American citizen in 1986.  He was charged with murder.  And I made a 
		point of talking about that in a press conference because I wanted not 
		only terrorists to understand, but the American people understand that 
		we'll be patient, if need be, to bring them to justice.  We'll find 
		them.And he thought this -- this is an interesting case in Afghanistan 
		because it's -- he thought he had hijacked a country.  He actually did 
		for a while.  He forced a country to accept his radical thoughts.  And 
		it became a safe haven for bin Laden and the al Qaeda 
		organization.  It's no longer a safe haven, that's for sure, because our 
		military activity, David.Yes, Elizabeth.Question:Mr. President, you've tried very hard to assure Americans that 
		the country is safe, and yet your own Vice President has spent most 
		of this week in a secure location.  Can you explain why that is, and 
		also how long that will last?President Bush:Sure.  I shook hands with the Vice President today 
		in the Oval Office.  I welcomed him out of his secure 
		location. There are some times when the Vice President and 
		I will be together, and sometimes we won't be.  We take very seriously 
		the notion of the continuity of government.  It's a responsibility we 
		share, to make sure that under situations such as this, when there are 
		possible threats facing our government, that we separate ourselves, for 
		the sake of continuity of our government.  And I was pleased to see 
		him.  He's looking swell.Jim.Question:Thank you, Mr. President.  Sir, some critics have expressed 
		doubts about trying to get nations that once sponsored terrorism 
		to now cooperate in the effort against terrorism.  Would you share your 
		thinking with us, sir, and is it your view that every sinner should get 
		a chance to redeem himself -- that there is, in effect, an amnesty for 
		nations that once sponsored terrorism if they will now stop and 
		cooperate with us?President Bush:Of course.  But our ability to affect host nations 
		harboring terrorists will depend upon our determination, our will, our 
		patience.  We are sending a signal to the world as we speak that if you 
		harbor a terrorist, there will be a price to pay.And there are nations in the world that have expressed a desire to 
		help.  Helen mentioned Syria.  The Syrians have talked to us 
		about how they can help in the war against terrorism.  We take that -- 
		we take that seriously and we'll give them an opportunity to do so.I'm a performance-oriented person, I believe in 
		results.  And if you want to join the coalition against terror, we'll 
		welcome you in.  I have recognized some countries will do things that 
		others won't do.  All I ask is for results.  If you say you want to join 
		us to cut off money, show us the money.  If you say you want to join us 
		militarily, like Great Britain does, do so -- and they have done so in a 
		fashion that should make the people of Great Britain proud.  If you're 
		interested in sharing intelligence, share intelligence -- all ways.I appreciate diplomatic talk, but I'm more interested in action and 
		results.  I am absolutely determined -- absolutely determined -- to rout 
		terrorism out where it exists and bring them to justice.  We learned a 
		good lesson on September the 11th,  that there is evil in this world.  I 
		know there's a lot of children in America wondering what took place.  I 
		think it's essential that all moms and dads and citizens tell their 
		children we love them and there is love in the world, but also remind 
		them there are evil people.And it's my duty as the President of the United States to use the 
		resources of this great nation, a freedom-loving nation, a compassionate 
		nation, a nation that understands values of life, and rout terrorism out 
		where it exists.  And we're going to give plenty of nations a chance to 
		do so.Terry.Question:Back to the FBI warning of today, which was based, it 
		said, on certain information that there would be retaliatory attacks 
		over the next several days.  Given the complete generality of that 
		warning, what does it really accomplish, aside from scaring people into 
		not doing what you've urged them to do -- getting back to their normal 
		lives -- what should they do with it, and did you personally approve the 
		issuance of that warning?President Bush:I'm aware of the intelligence that caused the 
		warning to be issued, and it was a general threat on America.  And as I 
		mentioned earlier, had it been a specific threat, we would have 
		contacted those to whom the threat was directed.But, Terry, I think it is important for the American people to know 
		their government is on full alert.  And that's what that warning 
		showed. We take every threat seriously.  And the American people 
		shouldn't be surprised that we're issuing alerts.  After all, on our TV 
		screens the other day, we saw the evil one threatening -- calling for 
		more destruction and death in America. And so we should take these 
		threats seriously.  And we had another threat, a general threat.  Had it 
		been specific, we would have dealt with the specifics of the threat.I think the American people should take comfort in the fact that 
		their government is doing everything we possibly can do to run down 
		every possible lead, and take threats -- and we take threats seriously.I think the American people do understand that after September 
		11th, that we're facing a different world.  And they accept that 
		responsibility. They accept that responsibility.  There is, I think, 
		some positive news about the American people reacting to what we're 
		doing.  The load factors on airplanes are 
		increasing.  Now, I recognize certain routes have been reduced, but 
		nevertheless, people are getting back on airplanes.  That's important 
		that that be the case.  Hotels are getting more customers. That's 
		important for the working people of the country.We are getting back to normal.  We're doing so with a new sense of 
		awareness.  And the warning that went out today helped heighten that 
		sense of awareness.John.Question:Mr. President, you've said on repeated occasions that you're 
		not into nation-building.  Yet, it appears in this case, given 
		the politics of the region, it may play a crucial role in resolving this 
		crisis.  Prime Minister Blair of Britain has said that the coalition, if 
		the Taliban falls, will work to create a broadly-based government.  I'm 
		wondering, sir, has that become a priority of your Administration now, 
		to devise a plan for a new government in Afghanistan?  And what part 
		might King Zaher Shah play in that?President Bush:Well, I think it's -- John, it's a -- first let me 
		reiterate, my focus is bringing al Qaeda to justice and saying to the 
		host government, you had your chance to deliver.  Actually, I will say 
		it again -- if you cough him up, and his people, today, that we'll 
		reconsider what we're doing to your country.  You still have a second 
		chance.  Bring him in.  And bring his leaders and lieutenants and 
		other thugs and criminals with him.I think we did learn a lesson, however, from -- and should learn a 
		lesson -- from the previous engagement in the Afghan area, that we 
		should not just simply leave after a military objective has been 
		achieved.  That's why -- and I sent that signal by announcing that we're 
		going to spend $320 million of aid to the Afghan people.  That's 
		up from roughly $170 million this year.I personally think that a -- and I appreciate Tony Blair's -- and 
		I've discussed this with him -- his vision about Afghan after we're 
		successful -- Afghanistan after we're successful.  One of the things 
		we've got to make sure of is that all parties, all interested parties 
		have an opportunity to be a part of a new government; that we shouldn't 
		play favorites between one group or another within Afghanistan.Secondly, we've got to work for a stable Afghanistan so that her 
		neighbors don't fear terrorist activity again coming out of that 
		country. Third, it would be helpful, of course, to eradicate narco-trafficking out of Afghanistan, as well.I believe that the United Nations would -- could provide the 
		framework necessary to help meet those conditions.  It would be a useful 
		function for the United Nations to take over the so-called 
		""nation-building,"" -- I would call it the stabilization of a future 
		government -- after our military mission is complete.  We'll 
		participate; other countries will participate. I've talked to many 
		countries will participate.  I've talked to many countries that are 
		interested in making sure that the post-operations Afghanistan is one 
		that is stable, and one that doesn't become yet again a haven for 
		terrorist criminals.Ken.Question:Mr. President, I'm sure many Americans are wondering where all 
		this will lead.  And you've called upon the country to go back to 
		business and to go back to normal.  But you haven't called for any
		sacrifices from the American people.  And I wonder, do you feel that 
		any will be needed? Are you planning to call for any?  And do you think 
		that American life will really go back to the way it was on September 
		10th?President Bush:Well, you know, I think the American people are 
		sacrificing now.  I think they're waiting in airport lines longer than 
		they've ever had before.  I think that -- I think there's a certain 
		sacrifice when you lose a piece of your soul.  And Americans -- I was 
		standing up there at the Pentagon today, and I saw the tears of the 
		families whose lives were lost in the Pentagon.  And I said in my talk 
		there that America prays with you.  I think there's a sacrifice, there's 
		a certain sense of giving themselves to share their grief with people 
		they'll never, maybe, ever see in their lives.So America is sacrificing.  America -- I think the interesting 
		thing that has happened, and this is so sad an incident, but there are 
		some positive things developed -- that are developing.  One is, I 
		believe that many people are reassessing what's important in life.  Moms 
		and dads are not only reassessing their marriage and the importance of 
		their marriage, but of the necessity of loving their children like never 
		before.  I think that's one of the positives that have come from the 
		evildoers.The evil ones have sparked an interesting change in America, I 
		think -- a compassion in our country that is overflowing.  I know their 
		intended act was to destroy us and make us cowards and make us not want 
		to respond. But quite the opposite has happened -- our nation is united, 
		we are strong, we're compassionate; neighbors care about neighbors.The story I talked about earlier was one that really touched my 
		heart, about women of cover fearing to leave their homes.  And there was 
		such an outpouring of compassion for people within our own country, a 
		recognition that the Islamic faith should stand side by side, hand to 
		hand with the Jewish faith and the Christian faith in our great 
		land.  It is such a wonderful example.You know, I'm asked all the time -- I'll ask myself a question. 
		 How do I respond to -- it's an old trick --  
		how do I respond when I see that in some Islamic countries there is 
		vitriolic hatred for America?  I'll tell you how I respond:  I'm 
		amazed.  I'm amazed that there is such misunderstanding of what our 
		country is about, that people would hate us.  I am, I am -- like most 
		Americans, I just can't believe it.  Because I know how good we are, and 
		we've go to do a better job of making our case.  We've got to do a 
		better job of explaining to the people in the Middle East, for example, 
		that we don't fight a war against Islam or Muslims.  We don't hold any 
		religion accountable.  We're fighting evil.  And these murderers have 
		hijacked a great religion in order to justify their evil deeds.  And we 
		cannot let it stand.John.Question:Mr. President, you have spoken with great pride of this 
		international coalition.  I want to ask you, before the events of 
		September 11th, one of the big questions you faced this fall was, would 
		you violate theAntiballistic Missile Treatyand go ahead with 
		the missile defense plan if Russia did not strike a deal?  Will you do 
		that now because Russia's cooperation is so important?  And, separately, 
		but related, are you disappointed that while there have been some 
		statements of support from the Muslim world and the Arab world, 
		that there have not been more vocal and repeated statements agreeing 
		with you that this is a war against terrorism, not Islam?President Bush:John, let me start with the latter part.  I was 
		heartened by the Organization of Islamic Conference's statement 
		of support for our war against terror.1I think that that statement 
		spoke volumes about the attitude of Muslim nations, and I was pleased to 
		see that support.Some coalition members will feel more comfortable doing certain 
		things than other coalition members will.  And my attitude is, and the 
		attitude of my Administration is, we'll accept any help that a 
		government is comfortable in giving.  And we should not try to force 
		governments to do something that they can't do.  Any help is better than 
		no help.And so, I am so appreciative of the help we're getting in the 
		Middle East.  Somebody asked me the other day, was I pleased with the 
		actions of Saudi Arabia.  I am.  I appreciate the actions of that 
		government.In terms of missile defense, I can't wait to visit with my 
		friend, Vladimir Putin, in Shanghai, to reiterate once again that the 
		Cold War is over, it's done with, and that there are new threats that we 
		face; and no better example of that new threat than the attack on 
		America on September 11th.And I'm going to ask my friend to envision a world in which a 
		terrorist thug and/or a host nation might have the ability to develop -- 
		to deliver a weapon of mass destruction via a -- via rocket.  And 
		wouldn't it be in our nation's advantage to be able to shoot it 
		down?  At the very least, it should be in our nation's advantage to 
		determine whether we can shoot it down.  And we're restricted from doing 
		that because of an ABM Treaty that was signed during a totally different 
		era.The case cannot be even -- the case is more strong today than it 
		was on September 10th that the ABM is outmoded, outdated, reflects a 
		different time.  And I'm more than -- I am more than anxious to continue 
		making my case to them.  And we will do what's right in regards --Question:-- not agree, would you withdraw this year?President Bush:Excuse me, I have trouble hearing John.Question:If he does not agree with you, would you withdraw from theABM Treatythis year?President Bush:I have told Mr. Putin that the ABM Treaty is 
		outdated, antiquated and useless.  And I hope that he will join us in a 
		new strategic relationship.One more question, please.Question:You talk about the general threat toward Americans.  You know, 
		the Internet is crowded with all sorts of rumor and gossip and, kind of, 
		urban myths.  And people ask, what is it they're supposed to be on the 
		lookout for?  Other than the 22 most wanted terrorists, what are 
		Americans supposed to look for and report to the police or to the 
		FBI?President Bush:Well, Ann, you know, if you find a person that 
		you've never seen before getting in a crop duster that doesn't belong to 
		you -- -- report it.  If you see suspicious 
		people lurking around petrochemical plants, report it to law 
		enforcement.I mean, people need to be logical.  Now, listen, I want to urge my 
		fellow Americans not to use this as an opportunity to pick on somebody 
		that doesn't look like you, or doesn't share your religion.  The thing 
		that makes our nation so strong and that will ultimately defeat 
		terrorist activity is our willingness to tolerate people of different 
		faiths, different opinions, different colors within the fabric of our 
		society.And so I would urge my fellow Americans, obviously, if they see 
		something suspicious, abnormal, something that looks threatening, report 
		it to local law enforcement.Let me conclude by one final statement.  Thank you all for coming. 
		Before we leave, I want to make a special request to the children of 
		America.  I ask you to join in a special effort to help the children of 
		Afghanistan.  Their country has been through a great deal of war and 
		suffering.  Many children there are starving and are severely 
		malnourished. One in three Afghan children is an orphan.  Almost half 
		suffer chronic malnutrition.  And we can, and must, help them.We've created a special relief effort that will be supervised by 
		the Red Cross.  We are asking every child in America to earn or give a 
		dollar that will be used to provide food and medical help for the 
		children of Afghanistan.  You can send your dollar in an envelope, 
		marked ""America's Fund for Afghan Children,"" right here to the 
		White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C.This is an opportunity to help others, while teaching our own 
		children a valuable lesson about service and character.  I hope school 
		classes or Boys and Girl Scout troops, other youth organizations will 
		participate in any way to raise the money to send to the children.  Wash 
		your car.  Do a yard for a neighbor.  And I hope the adults will help 
		them, as well.Ultimately, one of the best weapons, one of the truest weapons that 
		we have against terrorism is to show the world the true strength of 
		character and kindness of the American people.  Americans are united in 
		this fight against terrorism.  We're also united in our concern for the 
		innocent people of Afghanistan. Winter is coming, and by acting today we 
		can help the children survive.Thank you for your questions.  May God bless America.",conference october time news conference war terrorismdelivered october white house washington browser support

for pdfGood morning and welcome to the White House.  Today, we take an 
		essential step in defeating terrorism, while protecting the 
		constitutional rights of all Americans.  With my signature, this law 
		will give intelligence and law enforcement officials important new tools 
		to fight a present danger.I commend the House and Senate for the hard work they put into this 
		legislation.  Members of Congress and their staffs spent long nights and 
		weekends to get this important bill to my desk.  I appreciate their 
		efforts, and bipartisanship, in passing this new law.I want to thank the Vice President and his staff for working hard to 
		make sure this law was passed.  I want to thank the Secretary of State 
		and the Secretary of Treasury for being here, both of whom lead 
		important parts of our war against terrorism.  I want to thank Attorney 
		General John Ashcroft for spending a lot of time on the Hill to make the 
		case for a balanced piece of legislation.  I want to thank the Director 
		of the FBI and the Director of the CIA for waging an incredibly 
		important part on the two-front war -- one overseas, and a front here at 
		home.I want to thank Governor Tom Ridge for his leadership.  I want to thank 
		the members of Congress who are here on the stage, the Leaders, on this 
		impressive effort.  Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy and Senator Sarbanes 
		and Senator Graham and Senator Reid.I also want to thank Representative Porter Goss, LaFalce, Oxley, and 
		Sensenbrenner for their hard work.  And I want to welcome the men and 
		women of law enforcement who are here in the White House with us today, 
		as well.The changes, effective today, will help counter a threat like no other 
		our nation has ever faced.  We've seen the enemy, and the murder of 
		thousands of innocent, unsuspecting people.  They recognize no barrier 
		of morality.  They have no conscience.  The terrorists cannot be 
		reasoned with.  Witness the recent anthrax attacks through our Postal 
		Service.Our country is grateful for the courage the Postal Service has shown 
		during these difficult times.  We mourn the loss of the lives of Thomas 
		Morris and Joseph Curseen; postal workers who died in the line of duty. 
		And our prayers go to their loved ones.I want to assure postal workers that our government is testing more than 
		200 postal facilities along the entire Eastern corridor that may have 
		been impacted.  And we will move quickly to treat and protect workers 
		where positive exposures are found.But one thing is for certain:  These terrorists must be pursued, they 
		must be defeated, and they must be brought to justice.  And 
		that is the purpose of this legislation.  Since the 11th of September, 
		the men and women of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have 
		been relentless in their response to new and sudden challenges.We have seen the horrors terrorists can inflict.  We may never know what 
		horrors our country was spared by the diligent and determined work of 
		our police forces, the FBI, ATF agents, federal marshals, Custom 
		officers, Secret Service, intelligence professionals and local law 
		enforcement officials, under the most trying conditions.  They are 
		serving this country with excellence, and often with bravery.They deserve our full support and every means of help that we can 
		provide.  We're dealing with terrorists who operate by highly 
		sophisticated methods and technologies, some of which were not even 
		available when our existing laws were written.  The bill before me takes 
		account of the new realities and dangers posed by modern terrorists.  It 
		will help law enforcement to identify, to dismantle, to disrupt, and to 
		punish terrorists before they strike.For example, this legislation gives law enforcement officials better 
		tools to put an end to financial counterfeiting, smuggling and 
		money-laundering.  Secondly, it gives intelligence operations and 
		criminal operations the chance to operate not on separate tracks, but to 
		share vital information so necessary to disrupt a terrorist attack 
		before it occurs.As of today, we're changing the laws governing information-sharing. And 
		as importantly, we're changing the culture of our various agencies that 
		fight terrorism.  Countering and investigating terrorist activity is the 
		number one priority for both law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Surveillance of communications is another essential tool to pursue and 
		stop terrorists.  The existing law was written in the era of rotary 
		telephones.  This new law that I sign today will allow surveillance of 
		all communications used by terrorists, including e-mails, the Internet, 
		and cell phones.As of today, we'll be able to better meet the technological challenges 
		posed by this proliferation of communications 
		technology.  Investigations are often slowed by limit on the reach of 
		federal search warrants.Law enforcement agencies have to get a new warrant for each new district 
		they investigate, even when they're after the same suspect.  Under this 
		new law, warrants are valid across all districts and across all 
		states.  And, finally, the new legislation greatly enhances the 
		penalties that will fall on terrorists or anyone who helps them.Current statutes deal more severely with drug-traffickers than with 
		terrorists.  That changes today.  We are enacting new and harsh 
		penalties for possession of biological weapons.  We're making it easier 
		to seize the assets of groups and individuals involved in terrorism. The 
		government will have wider latitude in deporting known terrorists and 
		their supporters. The statute of limitations on terrorist acts will be 
		lengthened, as will prison sentences for terrorists.This bill was carefully drafted and considered.  Led by the members of 
		Congress on this stage, and those seated in the audience, it was crafted 
		with skill and care, determination and a spirit of bipartisanship for 
		which the entire nation is grateful.  This bill met with an overwhelming 
		-- overwhelming agreement in Congress, because it upholds and respects 
		the civil liberties guaranteed by our Constitution.This legislation is essential not only to pursuing and punishing 
		terrorists, but also preventing more atrocities in the hands of the evil 
		ones.  This government will enforce this law with all the urgency of a 
		nation at war.  The elected branches of our government, and both 
		political parties, are united in our resolve to fight and stop and 
		punish those who would do harm to the American people.It is now my honor to sign into law the USA Patriot Act of 2001.",ing usa patriot act sign usa patriot act october washington require flash

for pdfThank you.  Mr. Secretary 
		General, Mr. President, distinguished delegates, and ladies and 
		gentlemen:We meet in a hall devoted to peace, in a city scarred by 
		violence, in a nation awakened to danger, in a world uniting for a long 
		struggle.  Every civilized nation here today is resolved to keep the 
		most basic commitment of civilization: We will defend ourselves and our 
		future against terror and lawless violence.The United Nations was 
		founded in this cause.  In a second world war, we learned there is no 
		isolation from evil.  We affirmed that some crimes are so terrible they 
		offend humanity, itself.  And we resolved that the aggressions and 
		ambitions of the wicked must be opposed early, decisively, and 
		collectively, before they threaten us all.  That evil has returned, and 
		that cause is renewed.A few miles from here, many 
		thousands still lie in a tomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the Secretary 
		General, the President of the General Assembly, and I will visit that 
		site, where the names of every nation and region that lost citizens will 
		be read aloud.  If we were to read the names of every person who died, 
		it would take more than three hours.Those names include a 
		citizen of Gambia, whose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary, 
		September the 12th, searching in vain for her husband. Those names 
		include a man who supported his wife in Mexico, sending home money every 
		week.  Those names include a young Pakistani who prayed toward Mecca 
		five times a day, and died that day trying to save others.The suffering of September 
		the 11th was inflicted on people of many faiths and many nations.  All 
		of the victims, including Muslims, were killed with equal indifference 
		and equal satisfaction by the terrorist leaders.  The terrorists are 
		violating the tenets of every religion, including the one they invoke.Last week, the Sheikh of 
		Al-Azhar University, the world's oldest Islamic institution of higher 
		learning, declared that terrorism is a disease, and that Islam prohibits 
		killing innocent civilians.  The terrorists call their cause holy, yet, 
		they fund it with drug dealing; they encourage murder and suicide in the 
		name of a great faith that forbids both.  They dare to ask God's 
		blessing as they set out to kill innocent men, women and children.  But 
		the God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer such a prayer.  And a 
		murderer is not a martyr; he is just a murderer.Time is passing.  Yet, for 
		the United States of America, there will be no forgetting September the 
		11th.  We will remember every rescuer who died in honor.  We will 
		remember every family that lives in grief.  We will remember the fire 
		and ash, the last phone calls, the funerals of the children.And the people of my country 
		will remember those who have plotted against us.  We are learning their 
		names.  We are coming to know their faces.  There is no corner of the 
		Earth distant or dark enough to protect them.  However long it takes, 
		their hour of justice will come.Every nation has a stake in 
		this cause.  As we meet, the terrorists are planning more murder -- 
		perhaps in my country, or perhaps in yours. They kill because they 
		aspire to dominate.  They seek to overthrow governments and destabilize 
		entire regions.Last week, anticipating this 
		meeting of the General Assembly, they denounced the United 
		Nations.  They called our Secretary General a criminal and condemned all 
		Arab nations here as traitors to Islam.Few countries meet their 
		exacting standards of brutality and oppression.  Every other country is 
		a potential target.  And all the world faces the most horrifying 
		prospect of all:  These same terrorists are searching for weapons of 
		mass destruction, the tools to turn their hatred into holocaust.  They 
		can be expected to use chemical, biological and nuclear weapons the 
		moment they are capable of doing so.  No hint of conscience would 
		prevent it.This threat cannot be 
		ignored.  This threat cannot be appeased. Civilization, itself, the 
		civilization we share, is threatened.  History will record our response, 
		and judge or justify every nation in this hall.The civilized world is now 
		responding.  We act to defend ourselves and deliver our children from a 
		future of fear.  We choose the dignity of life over a culture of 
		death.  We choose lawful change and civil disagreement over coercion, 
		subversion, and chaos.  These commitments -- hope and order, law and 
		life -- unite people across cultures and continents.  Upon these 
		commitments depend all peace and progress.  For these commitments, we 
		are determined to fight.The United Nations has risen 
		to this responsibility.  On the 12th of September, these buildings 
		opened for emergency meetings of the General Assembly and the Security 
		Council.  Before the sun had set, these attacks on the world stood 
		condemned by the world.  And I want to thank you for this strong and 
		principled stand.I also thank the Arab 
		Islamic countries that have condemned terrorist murder.  Many of you 
		have seen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The terrorists 
		are increasingly isolated by their own hatred and extremism. They cannot 
		hide behind Islam.  The authors of mass murder and their allies have no 
		place in any culture, and no home in any faith.The conspiracies of terror 
		are being answered by an expanding global coalition.  Not every nation 
		will be a part of every action against the enemy.  But every nation in 
		our coalition has duties.  These duties can be demanding, as we in 
		America are learning.  We have already made adjustments in our laws and 
		in our daily lives.  We're taking new measures to investigate terror and 
		to protect against threats.The leaders of all nations 
		must now carefully consider their responsibilities and their 
		future.  Terrorist groups like al Qaeda depend upon the aid or 
		indifference of governments.  They need the support of a financial 
		infrastructure, and safe havens to train and plan and hide.Some nations want to play 
		their part in the fight against terror, but tell us they lack the means 
		to enforce their laws and control their borders.  We stand ready to 
		help.  Some governments still turn a blind eye to the terrorists, hoping 
		the threat will pass them by.  They are mistaken. And some governments, 
		while pledging to uphold the principles of the U.N., have cast their lot 
		with the terrorists.  They support them and harbor them, and they will 
		find that their welcome guests are parasites that will weaken them, and 
		eventually consume them.For every regime that 
		sponsors terror, there is a price to be paid. And it will be paid.  The 
		allies of terror are equally guilty of murder and equally accountable to 
		justice.The Taliban are now learning 
		this lesson -- that regime and the terrorists who support it are now 
		virtually indistinguishable.  Together they promote terror abroad and 
		impose a reign of terror on the Afghan people.  Women are executed in 
		Kabal's soccer stadium.  They can be beaten for wearing socks that are 
		too thin.  Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings.The United States, supported 
		by many nations, is bringing justice to the terrorists in 
		Afghanistan.  We're making progress against military targets, and that 
		is our objective.  Unlike the enemy, we seek to minimize, not maximize, 
		the loss of innocent life.I'm proud of the honorable 
		conduct of the American military.  And my country grieves for all the 
		suffering the Taliban have brought upon Afghanistan, including the 
		terrible burden of war.  The Afghan people do not deserve their present 
		rulers.  Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothing but misery and 
		starvation.   Even before this current crisis, 4 million Afghans 
		depended on food from the United States and other nations, and millions 
		of Afghans were refugees from Taliban oppression.I make this promise to all 
		the victims of that regime:  The Taliban's days of harboring terrorists 
		and dealing in heroin and brutalizing women are drawing to a close.  And 
		when that regime is gone, the people of Afghanistan will say with the 
		rest of the world: good riddance.I can promise, too, that 
		America will join the world in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild 
		their country.  Many nations, including mine, are sending food and 
		medicine to help Afghans through the winter.  America has air-dropped 
		over 1.3 million packages of rations into Afghanistan. Just this week, 
		we air-lifted 20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions into the 
		region.  We continue to provide humanitarian aid, even while the Taliban 
		tried to steal the food we send.More help eventually will be 
		needed.  The United States will work closely with the United Nations and 
		development banks to reconstruct Afghanistan after hostilities there 
		have ceased and the Taliban are no longer in control.  And the United 
		States will work with the U.N. to support a post-Taliban government that 
		represents all of the Afghan people.In this war of terror, each 
		of us must answer for what we have done or what we have left 
		undone.  After tragedy, there is a time for sympathy and 
		condolence.  And my country has been very grateful for both.  The 
		memorials and vigils around the world will not be forgotten.  But the 
		time for sympathy has now passed; the time for action has now arrived.The most basic obligations 
		in this new conflict have already been defined by the United 
		Nations.  On September the 28th, the Security Council adopted Resolution 
		1373.  Its requirements are clear:  Every United Nations member has a 
		responsibility to crack down on terrorist financing.  We must pass all 
		necessary laws in our own countries to allow the confiscation of 
		terrorist assets.  We must apply those laws to every financial 
		institution in every nation.We have a responsibility to 
		share intelligence and coordinate the efforts of law enforcement.  If 
		you know something, tell us.  If we know something, we'll tell you.  And 
		when we find the terrorists, we must work together to bring them to 
		justice.  We have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary, safe haven or 
		transit to terrorists.  Every known terrorist camp must be shut down, 
		its operators apprehended, and evidence of their arrest presented to the 
		United Nations.  We have a responsibility to deny weapons to terrorists 
		and to actively prevent private citizens from providing them.These obligations are urgent 
		and they are binding on every nation with a place in this chamber.  Many 
		governments are taking these obligations seriously, and my country 
		appreciates it.  Yet, even beyond Resolution 1373, more is required, and 
		more is expected of our coalition against terror.We're asking for a 
		comprehensive commitment to this fight.  We must unite in opposing all 
		terrorists, not just some of them.  In this world there are good causes 
		and bad causes, and we may disagree on where the line is drawn.  Yet, 
		there is no such thing as a good terrorist.  No national aspiration, no 
		remembered wrong can ever justify the deliberate murder of the 
		innocent.  Any government that rejects this principle, trying to pick 
		and choose its terrorist friends, will know the consequences.We must speak the truth 
		about terror.  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories 
		concerning the attacks of September the 11th; malicious lies that 
		attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists, themselves, away 
		from the guilty.  To inflame ethnic hatred is to advance the cause of 
		terror.The war against terror must 
		not serve as an excuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities in 
		any country. Innocent people must be allowed to live their own lives, 
		by their own customs, under their own religion. And every nation must 
		have avenues for the peaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When 
		these avenues are closed, the temptation to speak through violence 
		grows.We must press on with our 
		agenda for peace and prosperity in every land.  My country is pledged to 
		encouraging development and expanding trade.  My country is pledged to 
		investing in education and combating AIDS and other infectious diseases 
		around the world.  Following September 11th, these pledges are even more 
		important.  In our struggle against hateful groups that exploit poverty 
		and despair, we must offer an alternative of opportunity and hope.The American government also 
		stands by its commitment to a just peace in the Middle East.  We are 
		working toward a day when two states, Israel and Palestine, live 
		peacefully together within secure and recognize borders as called for by 
		the Security Council resolutions.  We will do all in our power to bring 
		both parties back into negotiations.  But peace will only come when all 
		have sworn off, forever, incitement, violence and terror.And, finally, this struggle 
		is a defining moment for the United Nations, itself.  And the world 
		needs its principled leadership.  It undermines the credibility of this 
		great institution, for example, when the Commission on Human Rights 
		offers seats to the world's most persistent violators of human 
		rights.  The United Nations depends, above all, on its moral authority 
		-- and that authority must be preserved.The steps I described will 
		not be easy.  For all nations, they will require effort.  For some 
		nations, they will require great courage.  Yet, the cost of inaction is 
		far greater.  The only alternative to victory is a nightmare world where 
		every city is a potential killing field.As I've told the American 
		people, freedom and fear are at war.  We face enemies that hate not our 
		policies, but our existence; the tolerance of openness and creative 
		culture that defines us.  But the outcome of this conflict is 
		certain:  There is a current in history and it runs toward freedom.  Our 
		enemies resent it and dismiss it, but the dreams of mankind are defined 
		by liberty -- the natural right to create and build and worship and live 
		in dignity.  When men and women are released from oppression and 
		isolation, they find fulfillment and hope, and they leave poverty by the 
		millions.These aspirations are 
		lifting up the peoples of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, and 
		they can lift up all of the Islamic world.We stand for the permanent 
		hopes of humanity, and those hopes will not be denied.  We're confident, 
		too, that history has an author who fills time and eternity with his 
		purpose.  We know that evil is real, but good will prevail against 
		it.  This is the  teaching of many faiths, and in that assurance we gain 
		strength for a long journey.It is our task -- the task 
		of this generation -- to provide the response to aggression and 
		terror.  We have no other choice, because there is no other peace.We did not ask for this 
		mission, yet there is honor in history's call. We have a chance to write 
		the story of our times, a story of courage defeating cruelty and light 
		overcoming darkness.  This calling is worthy of any life, and worthy of 
		every nation.  So let us go forward, confident, determined, and 
		unafraid.Thank you very much.",sh speech unite nation general assembly november address unite nation general assemblydelivered november headquarter new yorkaudio require flash audioyour browser

20,11 December 2001,>George W. Bush - Address to Citadel Cade,"adel CadetsGeorgeW.BushAddress to Citadel Cadetsdelivered 11 
December 2001, Charleston, South CarolinaAudio mp3 of AddressPlug-in required for flash audioYour browser does not support the audio element.click 
for pdfI'm glad to be back here at the Citadel.I have come to talk about the future security of our country, in a place 
		where I took up this subject two years ago when I was candidate for 
		President.  In September 1999,I said here at the Citadelthat America 
		was entering a period of consequences that would be defined by the 
		threat of terror, and that we faced a challenge of military 
		transformation.  That threat has now revealed itself, and that challenge 
		is now the military and moral necessity of our time. So, today, I will 
		set forth the commitments essential to victory in our war against 
		terror.I want to thank Major General John Grinalds for his hospitality.  I want 
		to thank the Citadel Board of Visitors, the staff, and the faculty.  I 
		understand the Governor is here.  And I know my friends, the Lt. 
		Governor, the Speaker and the Attorney General are here, and it was 
		great to have seen them at the airport.  I thank my friend, Adjutant 
		General Stan Spears for being here.I'm grateful that Senator Hollings and members of the South Carolina 
		congressional delegation flew down on Air Force One.  I only wish that 
		the senior Senator was on the airplane so I could have wished him a 
		happy 99th birthday.But most of all, most of all, I want to say how much I appreciate being 
		in the presence of some of America's finest, the South Carolina Corp of 
		Cadets of Citadel.Four days ago, I joined the men and women of the USS Enterprise to mark 
		the 60th anniversary of Pearl Harbor.December 7th, 1941was a decisive 
		day that changed our nation forever.  In a single moment, America's 
		""splendid isolation"" was ended.  And the four years that followed 
		transformed the American way of war.The age of battleships gave way to the offensive capability of aircraft 
		carriers.  The tank, once used only to protect infantry, now served to 
		cut through enemy lines.  At Guadalcanal, and Normandy, and Iwo Jima, 
		amphibious warfare proved its worth.  And by war's end, no one would 
		ever again doubt the value of strategic air power.Even more importantly, an American President and his successors shaped a 
		world beyond a war.  They rebuilt Europe with the Marshall Plan, formed 
		a great alliance for freedom in NATO, and expressed the hope of 
		collective security in the United Nations.  America took the lead, 
		becoming freedom's defender and assuming responsibilities that only we 
		could bear.September 11th, 2001-- three months and a long time ago -- set another 
		dividing line in our lives and in the life of our nation.  An illusion 
		of immunity was shattered.  A faraway evil became a present danger.  And 
		a great cause became clear:  We will fight terror and those who sponsor 
		it, to save our children from a future of fear.To win this war, we have to think differently.  The enemy who appeared 
		on September 11th seeks to evade our strength and constantly searches 
		for our weaknesses.  So America is required once again to change the way 
		our military thinks and fights.  And starting on October 7th, the enemy 
		in Afghanistan got the first glimpses of a new American military that 
		cannot, and will not, be evaded.When I committed U.S. forces to this battle, I had every confidence that 
		they would be up to the task.  And they have proven me right.  The 
		Taliban and the terrorists set out to dominate a country and intimidate 
		the world.  Today, from their caves, it's all looking a little 
		different.  And no cave is deep enough to escape the patient justice 
		of the United States of America.We are also beginning to see the possibilities of a world beyond the war 
		on terror.  We have a chance, if we take it, to write a hopeful chapter 
		in human history.  All at once, a new threat to civilization is erasing 
		old lines of rivalry and resentment between nations.  Russia and America 
		are building a new cooperative relationship.  India and the United 
		States are increasingly aligned across a range of issues, even as we 
		work closely with Pakistan.  Germany and Japan are assuming new military 
		roles, appropriate to their status as great democracies.The vast majority of countries are now on the same side of a moral and 
		ideological divide.  We're making common cause with every nation that 
		chooses lawful change over chaotic violence -- every nation that values 
		peace and safety and innocent life.Staring across this divide are bands of murderers, supported by outlaw 
		regimes.  They are a movement defined by their hatreds.  They hate 
		progress, and freedom, and choice, and culture, and music, and laughter, 
		and women, and Christians, and Jews, and all Muslims who reject their 
		distorted doctrines.  They love only one thing -- they love power.  And 
		when they have it, they use it without mercy.The great threat to civilization is not that the terrorists will inspire 
		millions.  Only the terrorists themselves would want to live in their 
		brutal and joyless world.  The great threat to civilization is that a 
		few evil men will multiply their murders, and gain the means to kill on 
		a scale equal to their hatred.  We know they have this mad intent, and 
		we're determined to stop them.Our lives, our way of life, and our every hope for the world depend on a 
		single commitment:  The authors of mass murder must be defeated, and 
		never allowed to gain or use the weapons of mass destruction.America and our friends will meet this threat with every method at our 
		disposal.  We will discover and destroy sleeper cells.  We will track 
		terrorist movements, trace their communications, disrupt their funding, 
		and take their network apart, piece by piece.Above all, we're acting to end the state sponsorship of terror.  Rogue 
		states are clearly the most likely sources of chemical and biological 
		and nuclear weapons for terrorists.  Every nation now knows that we 
		cannot accept -- and we will not accept -- states that harbor, finance, 
		train, or equip the agents of terror.  Those nations that violate this 
		principle will be regarded as hostile regimes.  They have been warned, 
		they are being watched, and they will be held to account.Preventing mass terror will be the responsibilities of Presidents far 
		into the future.  And this obligation sets three urgent and enduring 
		priorities for America.  The first priority is to speed the 
		transformation of our military.When the Cold War ended, some predicted that the era of direct threats 
		to our nation was over.  Some thought our military would be used 
		overseas -- not to win wars, but mainly to police and pacify, to control 
		crowds and contain ethnic conflict.  They were wrong.While the threats to America have changed, the need for victory has 
		not.  We are fighting shadowy, entrenched enemies -- enemies using the 
		tools of terror and guerrilla war -- yet we are finding new tactics and 
		new weapons to attack and defeat them.  This revolution in our military 
		is only beginning, and it promises to change the face of battle.Afghanistan has been a proving ground for this new approach.  These past 
		two months have shown that an innovative doctrine and high-tech weaponry 
		can shape and then dominate an unconventional conflict.  The brave men 
		and women of our military are rewriting the rules of war with new 
		technologies and old values like courage and honor.  And they have made 
		this nation proud.Our commanders are gaining a real-time picture of the entire 
		battlefield, and are able to get targeting information from sensor to 
		shooter almost instantly.  Our intelligence professionals and special 
		forces have cooperated in battle-friendly -- with battle-friendly Afghan 
		forces -- fighters who know the terrain, who know the Taliban, and who 
		understand the local culture.  And our special forces have the 
		technology to call in precision air strikes -- along with the 
		flexibility to direct those strikes from horseback, in the first cavalry 
		charge of the 21st century.This combination -- real-time intelligence, local allied forces, special 
		forces, and precision air power -- has really never been used 
		before.  The conflict in Afghanistan has taught us more about the future 
		of our military than a decade of blue ribbon panels and think-tank 
		symposiums.The Predator is a good example.  This unmanned aerial vehicle is able to 
		circle over enemy forces, gather intelligence, transmit information 
		instantly back to commanders, then fire on targets with extreme 
		accuracy.Before the war, the Predator had skeptics, because it did not fit the 
		old ways.  Now it is clear the military does not have enough unmanned 
		vehicles.  We're entering an era in which unmanned vehicles of all kinds 
		will take on greater importance -- in space, on land, in the air, and at 
		sea.Precision-guided munitions also offer great promise.  In the Gulf War, 
		these weapons were the exception -- while in Afghanistan, they have been 
		the majority of the munitions we have used.  We're striking with greater 
		effectiveness, at greater range, with fewer civilian casualties.  More 
		and more, our weapons can hit moving targets.  When all of our military 
		can continuously locate and track moving targets -- with surveillance 
		from air and space -- warfare will be truly revolutionized.The need for military transformation was clear before the conflict in 
		Afghanistan, and before September the 11th.  Here at the Citadel in 
		1999, I spoke of keeping the peace by redefining war on our terms.  The 
		same recommendation was made in the strategic review that Secretary 
		Rumsfeld briefed me on last August -- a review that I fully 
		endorse.  What's different today is our sense of urgency -- the need to 
		build this future force while fighting a present war.  It's like 
		overhauling an engine while you're going at 80 miles an hour.  Yet we 
		have no other choice.Our military has a new and essential mission.  For states that support 
		terror, it's not enough that the consequences be costly -- they must be 
		devastating.  The more credible this reality, the more likely that 
		regimes will change their behavior -- making it less likely that America 
		and our friends will need to use overwhelming force against them.To build our future force, the Armed Services must continue to attract 
		America's best people, with good pay and good living conditions.  Our 
		military culture must reward new thinking, innovation, and 
		experimentation.  Congress must give defense leaders the freedom to 
		innovate, instead of micromanaging the Defense Department.  And every 
		service and every constituency of our military must be willing to 
		sacrifice some of their own pet projects.  Our war on terror cannot be 
		used to justify obsolete bases, obsolete programs, or obsolete weapon 
		systems.  Every dollar of defense spending must meet a single test:  It 
		must help us build the decisive power we will need to win the wars of 
		the future.Our country is united in supporting a great cause -- and in supporting 
		those who fight for it.  We will give our men and women in uniform every 
		resource, every weapon, every tool they need to win the long battle that 
		lies ahead.America's next priority to prevent mass terror is to protect against the 
		proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver 
		them.  I wish I could report to the American people that this threat 
		does not exist -- that our enemy is content with car bombs and box 
		cutters -- but I cannot.One former al Qaeda member has testified in court that he was involved 
		in an effort 10 years ago to obtain nuclear materials.  And the leader 
		of al Qaeda calls that effort ""a religious duty.""  Abandoned al Qaeda 
		houses in Kabul contained diagrams for crude weapons of mass 
		destruction.  And as we all know, terrorists have put anthrax into the 
		U.S. mail, and used sarin gas in a Tokyo subway.And almost every state that actively sponsors terror is known to be 
		seeking weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them at 
		longer and longer ranges.  Their hope is to blackmail the United States 
		into abandoning our war on terror, and forsaking our friends and allies 
		and security commitments around the world.  Our enemies are bound for 
		disappointment.  America will never be blackmailed, and we will never 
		forsake our commitment to liberty.To meet our new threats, I have directed my National Security Advisor 
		and my Homeland Security Director to develop a comprehensive strategy on 
		proliferation.  Working with other countries, we will strengthen 
		nonproliferation treaties and toughen export controls.  Together, we 
		must keep the world's most dangerous technologies out of the hands of 
		the world's most dangerous people.A crucial partner in this effort is Russia -- a nation we are helping to 
		dismantle strategic weapons, reduce nuclear material, and increase 
		security at nuclear sites.  Our two countries will expand efforts to 
		provide peaceful employment for scientists who formerly worked in Soviet 
		weapons facilities.  The United States will also work with Russia to 
		build a facility to destroy tons of nerve agent.  I'll request an 
		over-all increase in funding to support this vital mission.Even as we fight to prevent proliferation, we must prepare for every 
		possibility.  At home, we must be better prepared to detect, protect 
		against, and respond to the potential use of weapons of mass 
		destruction.  Abroad, our military forces must have the ability to fight 
		and win against enemies who would use such weapons against us.Biodefense has become a major initiative of ours.  This year we've 
		already requested nearly $3 billion additional dollars for biodefense, 
		more than doubling the level of funding prior to September the 11th.The attacks on our nation made it even more clear that we need to build 
		limited and effective defenses against a missile attack.  Our enemies 
		seek every chance and every means to do harm to our country, our forces, 
		and our friends.  And we will not permit it.Suppose the Taliban and the terrorists had been able to strike America 
		or important allies with a ballistic missile.  Our coalition would have 
		become fragile, the stakes in our war much, much higher.  We must 
		protect Americans and our friends against all forms of terror, including 
		the terror that could arrive on a missile.Last week we conducted another promising test of our missile defense 
		technology.  For the good of peace, we're moving forward with an active 
		program to determine what works and what does not work.  In order to do 
		so, we must move beyond the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a treaty 
		that was written in a different era, for a different enemy.America and our allies must not be bound to the past.  We must be able 
		to build the defenses we need against the enemies of the 21st century.Our third and final priority in the fight against mass terror is to 
		strengthen the advantage that good intelligence gives our 
		country.  Every day I make decisions influenced by the intelligence 
		briefing of that morning.  To reach decisions, a President needs more 
		than data and information.  A President needs real and current knowledge 
		and analysis of the plans, intentions, and capabilities of our enemies.The last several months have shown that there is no substitute for good 
		intelligence officers, people on the ground.  These are the people who 
		find the targets, follow our enemies, and help us disrupt their evil 
		plans.The United States must rebuild our network of human intelligence.  And 
		we will apply the best new technology to gather intelligence on the new 
		threats.  Sophisticated systems like Global Hawk, an unmanned 
		surveillance plane, are transforming our intelligence capabilities.  Our 
		technological strengths produce great advantages, and we will build on 
		them.Our intelligence services and federal law enforcement agencies must work 
		more closely together, and share timely information with our state and 
		local authorities.  The more we know, the more terrorist plans we can 
		prevent and disrupt, and the better we'll be able to protect the 
		American people.And in all they do, our intelligence agencies must attract the best 
		people -- the best collectors, the best analysts, the best 
		linguists.  We will give them the training they need and the 
		compensation they deserve.There have been times here in America when our intelligence services 
		were held in suspicion, and even contempt.  Now, when we face this new 
		war, we know how much we need them.  And for their dedication and for 
		their service, America is grateful.We're also grateful to you, the students of the Citadel.  Your uniforms 
		symbolize a tradition of honor and sacrifice, renewed in your own 
		lives.  Many of you will enter our military -- taking your place in the 
		war against terror.  That struggle may continue for many years, and it 
		may bring great costs.  But you will have chosen a great calling at a 
		crucial hour for our nation.The course we follow is a matter of profound consequence to many 
		nations.  If America wavers, the world will lose heart.  If America 
		leads, the world will show its courage.  America will never 
		waver.  America will lead the world to peace.Our cause is necessary.  Our cause is just.  And no matter how long it 
		takes, we will defeat the enemies of freedom.In all that is to come, I know the graduates of the Citadel will bring 
		credit to America, to the military, and to this great institution.  In 
		the words of your school song, you will go where you've always gone -- 
		""in the Paths our fathers showed us...Peace and Honor, God and Country, 
		We will fight for thee.""God bless.",adel citadel cadetsdelivered december charleston south carolinaaudio require flash audioyour browser support audio pdfi glad back come talk future security

for pdfA great writer has said 
		that the struggle of humanity against tyranny is the struggle of memory 
		against forgetting. When we fight terror, we fight tyranny; and so we 
		remember. We remember the perfect blueness of the sky that Tuesday 
		morning. We remember the children traveling without their mothers when 
		their planes were hijacked.We remember the cruelty of 
		the murderers and the pain and anguish of the murdered. Every one of the 
		innocents who died on September the 11th was the most important person 
		on earth to somebody. Every death extinguished a world.We remember the courage of 
		the rescue workers and the outpouring of friendship and sympathy from 
		nations around the world. We remember how we felt that day: our sadness, 
		the surge of love for our country, our anger, and our determination to 
		right this huge wrong.Today, the wrong is being 
		righted and justice is being done. We still have far to go. And many 
		dangers lie ahead. Yet, there can be no doubt how this conflict will 
		end. Our enemies have made the mistake that America's enemies always 
		make. They saw liberty and thought they saw weakness. And now, they see 
		defeat.In time, this war will 
		end. But our remembrance never will. All around this beautiful city are 
		statues of our heroes, memorials, museums and archives that preserve our 
		national experience, our achievements and our failures, our defeats and 
		our victories.This republic is young, 
		but its memory is long. Now, we have inscribed a new memory alongside 
		those others. It's a memory of tragedy and shock, of loss and mourning. 
		But not only of loss and mourning. It's also a memory of bravery and 
		self-sacrifice, and the love that lays down its life for a friend -- 
		even a friend whose name it never knew.We are privileged to have 
		with us the families of many of the heroes on September the 11th, 
		including the family of Jeremy Glick of Flight 93. His courage and 
		self-sacrifice may have saved the White House. It is right and fitting 
		that it is here we pay our respects.In time, perhaps, we will 
		mark the memory of September the 11th in stone and metal -- something we 
		can show children as yet unborn to help them understand what happened on 
		this minute and on this day.But for those of us who 
		lived through these events, the only marker we'll ever need is the tick 
		of a clock at the 46th minute of the eighth hour of the 11th day. We 
		will remember where we were and how we felt. We will remember the dead 
		and what we owe them. We will remember what we lost and what we found.And in our time, we will 
		honor the memory of the 11th day by doing our duty as citizens of this 
		great country, freedom's home and freedoms defender.God bless.",always remember world always remember december require flash audioyour browser support audio pdfa great writer say struggle humanity tyranny struggle memory forget fight terror fight tyranny remember remember perfect blueness sky tuesday morning remember child travel without mother plan remember cruelty murderer pain anguish murder every one innocent die september important person earth somebody every death extinguish remember courage rescue worker outpouring friendship sympathy nation around world remember felt day sadness surge love country anger determination right huge wrong right justice do still far go many danger lie ahead yet doubt conflict end enemy make mistake america enemy always make saw liberty think saw weakness see time war end remembrance never around beautiful city statue hero memorial museum archive preserve national experience achievement failure defeat republic young memory long inscribe new memory alongside others memory tragedy shock loss mourn loss mourn also memory bravery love lay life friend even friend whose name never privilege u family many hero september include family jeremy glick flight courage may save white house right fit pay time perhaps mark memory september stone metal something show child yet unborn help understand happen minute u live event marker ever need tick clock minute eighth hour day remember felt remember dead owe remember lose time honor memory day duty citizen great country freedom home freedom bless,world require flash browser support audio pdfa writer struggle humanity memory forget fight terror fight blueness sky tuesday morning child travel mother plan cruelty murderer murder innocent person earth somebody death remember courage rescue worker nation world day sadness surge country anger determination justice danger lie end enemy mistake america enemy liberty saw weakness time war end remembrance city statue hero museum preserve experience failure defeat memory memory others tragedy shock loss mourn loss mourn bravery love life friend name family september family jeremy glick flight courage house pay time memory september stone metal something show child help minute event marker clock minute hour day time memory day duty country freedom home freedom bless
22,29 January 2002,>George W. Bush - No Child Left Behind Signing Spee,"Okay!  I know you all 
			are anxious to get back to class.  So please be seated.  Thank you 
			for such a warm welcome.  It's great to be in the home of the Big 
			Blue --Hamilton 
			High School.  I want to thank you all for coming.  I 
			particularly want to thank my friend, the Governor of the great 
			state of Ohio, Governor Taft, for being here.I want to thank Tracy 
			Miller for being so hospitable.  I want to thank all who have come 
			to witness this historic moment.  For those of you who have studied 
			the history of our government, you know most bills are signed at the 
			White House.  But I decided to sign this bill in one of the most 
			important places in America -- a public school.We've got large 
			challenges here in America.  There's no greater challenge than to 
			make sure that every child -- and all of us on this stage mean every 
			child, not just a few children -- every single child, regardless of 
			where they live, how they're raised, the income level of their 
			family, every child receive a first-class education in America.And as you know, we've 
			got another challenge, and that's to protect America from evil 
			ones.  And I want to assure the seniors and juniors and sophomores 
			here at Hamilton High School that the effort that this great country 
			is engaged in, the effort to defend freedom and to defend our 
			people, the effort to rout out terror wherever it exists, is noble 
			and just and right, and your great country will prevail in this 
			effort.I long for peace.  But 
			I also understand that if we do not lead the world against terror, 
			that your children and your grandchildren will not grow up in a 
			society that is as free as the society we have today.  Freedom is 
			the precious gift that one generation can pass to the next.  It is a 
			gift and a promise that I intend to keep to the American children.And we owe the 
			children of America a good education.  And today begins a new era, a 
			new time in public education in our country.  As of this hour, 
			America's schools will be on a new path of reform, and a new path of 
			results.Our schools will have 
			higher expectations.  We believe every child can learn.  Our schools 
			will have greater resources to help meet those goals. Parents will 
			have more information about the schools, and more say in how their 
			children are educated.  From this day forward, all students will 
			have a better chance to learn, to excel, and to live out their 
			dreams.I want to thank the 
			Secretary of Education, Rod Paige, for being here and for his 
			leadership.  I asked Rod to join my administration because I wanted 
			somebody who understood what it meant to run a school district in 
			Washington, D.C.  I didn't need somebody that based his knowledge on 
			theory; I wanted somebody who based his knowledge on 
			experience.  And Rod was a teacher, a school board member, and the 
			Superintendent of the Houston Independent School District.  He did a 
			fine job there, and he's doing a fine job in Washington.Reaching this moment 
			has not been easy, as you could tell from Chairman Boehner's 
			discussion.  But we made it, because of the willingness of four fine 
			leaders to do what was right for America.  We made it because proud 
			members of the House and the Senate, loyal to their parties, decided 
			to set partisan politics aside and focus on what was right for 
			America.I want to thank George 
			Miller.  I call him Big George, Jorge el Grande.  As John mentioned, 
			George and I aren't from the same political ideology -- except when 
			I met with George in Austin, I could tell he shares the same passion 
			I share for making sure that every child gets educated.  And he, 
			like me and others, realize that a system that simply shuffles 
			children through the schools is a system that's going to leave 
			people behind.  And so we made up our minds right then and there to 
			do something about it.I appreciate so very 
			much my friend, Judd Gregg, from the state of New Hampshire, being 
			here.  He was my campaign manager in the New Hampshire primary.  I 
			still invited him to come with me.  After here, we're going to New 
			Hampshire.  I look forward to singing Judd's praises because he is a 
			solid, solid United States senator -- honest, full of integrity, and 
			like the others here, he buckled down to do what was right for the 
			children.And then, of course, 
			there's Senator Edward Kennedy.  And the folks at the Crawford 
			Coffee Shop -- would be somewhat shocked when I told them I actually 
			like the fellow.  He is a fabulous United States senator.  When he's 
			against you, it's tough.  When he's with you, it is a great 
			experience.And I'm signing this 
			bill here because it's the home of the Chairman, John Boehner.  John 
			did a really good job.  He shepherded the process.  He made sure 
			people showed up for the meetings.  He was dogged in his 
			determination to get this bill done.  It would not have happened 
			without his leadership.  And all four of these members up here need 
			to be proud of the legacy they have left behind.  This is a good 
			bill for the American children, and I'm proud to sign it in their 
			presence.There are other 
			members of the Congress who are here, as well, and I want to thank 
			them for coming.  Senator Evan Bayh from the state of Indiana, is 
			here.  Evan, thank you for your leadership on education reform. 
			Senator Mike DeWine of your state of Ohio, who helped author -- who 
			helped to author the safe and drug-free schools part of this 
			bill.  Thank you for your leadership.Steve Chabot of Ohio, 
			Van Hilleary of Tennessee -- thank you both for coming, as well.  In 
			that box is the bill.  I don't intend to read it all.  It's not 
			exactly light reading.  But if you were to read it all, you would 
			find that it contains some very important principles that will help 
			guide our public school system for the next decades.First principle is 
			accountability.  Every school has a job to do.  And that's to teach 
			the basics and teach them well.  If we want to make sure no child is 
			left behind, every child must learn to read.  And every child must 
			learn to add and subtract.  So in return for federal dollars, we are 
			asking states to design accountability systems to show parents and 
			teachers whether or not children can read and write and add and 
			subtract in grades three through eight.The fundamental 
			principle of this bill is that every child can learn, we expect 
			every child to learn, and you must show us whether or not every 
			child is learning.  I read a quote one time from a young lady in New 
			York.  She said, ""I don't ever remember taking an exam.  They just 
			kept passing me along.  I ended up dropping out in the 7th grade.  I 
			basically felt nobody cared.""The story of children 
			being just shuffled through the system is one of the saddest stories 
			of America.  Let's just move them through.  It's so much easier to 
			move a child through than trying to figure out how to solve a 
			child's problems.  The first step to making sure that a child is not 
			shuffled through is to test that child as to whether or not he or 
			she can read and write, or add and subtract.The first way to solve 
			a problem is to diagnose it.  And so, what this bill says, it says 
			every child can learn.  And we want to know early, before it's too 
			late, whether or not a child has a problem in learning.  I 
			understand taking tests aren't fun.  Too bad.  We need to know in 
			America.  We need to know whether or not children have got the basic 
			education.No longer is it 
			acceptable to hide poor performance.  No longer is it acceptable to 
			keep results away from parents.  One of the interesting things about 
			this bill, it says that we're never going to give up on a school 
			that's performing poorly; that when we find poor performance, a 
			school will be given time and incentives and resources to correct 
			their problems.  A school will be given time to try other 
			methodologies, perhaps other leadership, to make sure that people 
			can succeed.  If, however, schools don't perform, if, however, given 
			the new resources, focused resources, they are unable to solve the 
			problem of not educating their children, there must be real 
			consequences.  There must be a moment in which parents can say, I've 
			had enough of this school.  Parents must be given real options in 
			the face of failure in order to make sure reform is meaningful.And so, therefore, 
			this bill's second principle is, is that we trust parents to make 
			the right decisions for their children.  Any school that doesn't 
			perform, any school that cannot catch up and do its job, a parent 
			will have these options -- a better public school, a tutor, or a 
			charter school.  We do not want children trapped in schools that 
			will not change and will not teach.The third principle of 
			this bill is that we have got to trust the local folks on how to 
			achieve standards, to meet the standards.  In Washington, there's 
			some smart people there, but the people who care most about the 
			children in Hamilton are the citizens of Hamilton.  The people who 
			care most about the children in this school are the teachers and 
			parents and school board members. And therefore, schools not only 
			have the responsibility to improve, they now have the freedom to 
			improve.The federal government 
			will not micromanage how schools are run.  We believe strongly -- we 
			believe strongly the best path to education reform is to trust the 
			local people.  And so the new role of the federal government is to 
			set high standards, provide resources, hold people accountable, and 
			liberate school districts to meet the standards.I can't think of any 
			better way to say to teachers, we trust you. And, first of all, 
			we've got to thank all the teachers who are here.  I thank you for 
			teaching. Yours is indeed a noble profession. And our society is 
			better off because you decided to teach.  And by saying we trust 
			local folks, we're really saying we trust you.  We trust you.  We 
			want you to have as much flexibility as possible to see to it that 
			every child that walks in your classroom can succeed.  So thank you 
			for what you do.And a fourth principle 
			is that we're going to spend more money, more resources, but they'll 
			be directed at methods that work.  Not feel-good methods, not 
			sound-good methods, but methods that actually work. Particularly 
			when it comes to reading.  We're going to spend more on our schools, 
			and we're going to spend it more wisely.If we've learned 
			anything over the last generations, money alone doesn't make a good 
			school.  It certainly helps.  But as John mentioned, we've spent 
			billions of dollars with lousy results.  So now it's time to spend 
			billions of dollars and get good results.As John mentioned, too 
			many of our kids can't read.  You know, a huge percentage of 
			children in poverty can't read at grade level.  That's not right in 
			America.  We're going to win the war overseas, and we need to win 
			the war against illiteracy here at home, as well.  And so this bill 
			-- so this bill focuses on reading.  It sets a grand goal for the 
			country.  Our children will be reading by the third grade.That's not an 
			impossible goal.  It's a goal we must meet if we want every child to 
			succeed.  And so, therefore, we tripled the amount of federal 
			funding for scientifically-based early reading programs.  We've got 
			money in there to make sure teachers know how to teach what 
			works.  We've got money in there to help promote proven methods of 
			instruction.There are no more 
			excuses, as far as I'm concerned, about not teaching children how to 
			read.  We know what works.  The money is now available, and it's up 
			to each local district to make sure it happens.  It's up to you, the 
			citizens of Hamilton, to make sure no child is left behind.  And the 
			federal government can spend money and we can help set standards, 
			and we can assist upon accountability.  But the truth of the matter 
			is our schools will flourish when citizens join in the noble cause 
			of making sure no child is left behind.This is the end of a 
			legislative process.  Signing this bill is the end of a long, long 
			time of people sitting in rooms trying to hammer out 
			differences.  It's a great symbol of what is possible in Washington 
			when good people come together to do what's right.  But it's just 
			the beginning of change.  And now it's up to you, the local citizens 
			of our great land, the compassionate, decent citizens of America, to 
			stand up and demand high standards, and to demand that no child -- 
			not one single child in America -- is left behind.Thank you for letting 
			us come.  May God bless.",okay know anxious get back class please seat thank warm welcome great home big blue hamilton high school want thank come particularly want thank friend governor great

for pdfThank you very much.Mr. Speaker, Vice President 

Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: As we 

gather tonight, our nation is at war, our economy is in recession, and the 

civilized world faces unprecedented dangers. Yet the state of our Union has 

never been stronger.We last met in an hour of shock and 

suffering.  In four short months, our nation has comforted the victims, begun to 

rebuild New York and the Pentagon, rallied a great coalition, captured, 

arrested, and rid the world of thousands of terrorists, destroyed Afghanistan's 

terrorist training camps, saved a people from starvation, and freed a country 

from brutal oppression.The American flag flies again over our embassy in 

Kabul. Terrorists who once occupied Afghanistan now occupy cells at Guantanamo 

Bay. And terrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice their 

lives are running for their own.America and Afghanistan are now allies against 

terror. We'll be partners in rebuilding that country. And this evening we 

welcome the distinguished interim leader of a liberated Afghanistan: Chairman Hamid Karzai.The last time we met in this chamber, the mothers 

and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from 

working or going to school.  Today women are free, and are part of Afghanistan's 

new government.  And we welcome the new Minister of Women's Affairs, Doctor Sima 

Samar.Our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the 

Afghan people, to the resolve of our coalition, and to the might of the United 

States military. When I called our troops into action, I did so 

with complete confidence in their courage and skill. And tonight, thanks to 

them, we are winning the war on terror. The man and women of our 

Armed Forces have delivered a message now clear to every enemy of the United 

States:  Even 7,000 miles away, across oceans and continents, on mountaintops 

and in caves -- you will not escape the justice of this nation.For many Americans, these four months have 

brought sorrow, and pain that will never completely go away. Every day a 

retired firefighter returns to Ground Zero, to feel closer to his two sons who 

died there. At a memorial in New York, a little boy left his football with a 

note for his lost father: Dear Daddy, please take this to heaven. I don't want 

to play football until I can play with you again some day.Last month, at the grave of her husband, Michael, 

a CIA officer and Marine who died in Mazur-e-Sharif, Shannon Spann said these 

words of farewell: ""Semper Fi, my love."" Shannon is with us tonight.Shannon, I assure you and all who have lost a 

loved one that our cause is just, and our country will never forget the debt we 

owe Michael and all who gave their lives for freedom.Our cause is just, and it continues. Our 

discoveries in Afghanistan confirmed our worst fears, and showed us the true 

scope of the task ahead. We have seen the depth of our enemies' hatred in 

videos, where they laugh about the loss of innocent life. And the depth of 

their hatred is equaled by the madness of the destruction they design. We have 

found diagrams of American nuclear power plants and public water facilities, 

detailed instructions for making chemical weapons, surveillance maps of American 

cities, and thorough descriptions of landmarks in America and throughout the 

world.What we have found in Afghanistan confirms that, 

far from ending there, our war against terror is only beginning. Most of the 19 

men who hijacked planes on September the 11th were trained in Afghanistan's 

camps, and so were tens of thousands of others. Thousands of dangerous 

killers, schooled in the methods of murder, often supported by outlaw regimes, 

are now spread throughout the world like ticking time bombs, set to go off 

without warning.Thanks to the work of our law enforcement 

officials and coalition partners, hundreds of terrorists have been arrested. 

Yet, tens of thousands of trained terrorists are still at large. These enemies 

view the entire world as a battlefield, and we must pursue them wherever they 

are. So long as training camps operate, so long as nations harbor 

terrorists, freedom is at risk. And America and our allies must not, and will 

not, allow it.Our nation will continue to be steadfast and 

patient and persistent in the pursuit of two great objectives. First, we will 

shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist plans, and bring terrorists to 

justice. And, second, we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek 

chemical, biological or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and 

the world.Our military has put the terror training camps of 

Afghanistan out of business, yet camps still exist in at least a dozen 

countries. A terrorist underworld -- including groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, 

Islamic Jihad, Jaish-i-Mohammed -- operates in remote jungles and deserts, and 

hides in the centers of large cities.While the most visible military action is in 

Afghanistan, America is acting elsewhere. We now have troops in the 

Philippines, helping to train that country's armed forces to go after terrorist 

cells that have executed an American, and still hold hostages. Our soldiers, 

working with the Bosnian government, seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb 

our embassy. Our Navy is patrolling the coast of Africa to block the shipment 

of weapons and the establishment of terrorist camps in Somalia.My hope is that all nations will heed our call, 

and eliminate the terrorist parasites who threaten their countries and our own. 

 Many nations are acting forcefully. Pakistan is now cracking down on terror, 

and I admire the strong leadership of President Musharraf.But some governments will be timid in the face of 

terror. And make no mistake about it: If they do not act, America will.Our second goal is to prevent regimes that 

sponsor terror from threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons 

of mass destruction. Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since 

September the 11th. But we know their true nature. North Korea is a regime 

arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its 

citizens.Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and 

exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for 

freedom.Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward 

America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, 

and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has 

already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens -- leaving the 

bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that 

agreed to international inspections -- then kicked out the inspectors. This is a 

regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.States like these, and their terrorist allies, 

constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By 

seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing 

danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to 

match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the 

United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be 

catastrophic.We will work closely with our coalition to deny 

terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to 

make and deliver weapons of mass destruction. We will develop and deploy 

effective missile defenses to protect America and our allies from sudden attack. 

And all nations should know: America will do what is necessary to 

ensure our nation's security.We'll be deliberate, yet time is not on our side. I will not wait on events, while dangers gather.  I will not stand by, as peril 

draws closer and closer. The United States of America will not permit the 

world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive 

weapons.Our war on terror is well begun, but it is only 

begun. This campaign may not be finished on our watch -- yet it must be and it 

will be waged on our watch.We can't stop short. If we stop now -- leaving 

terror camps intact and terror states unchecked -- our sense of security would 

be false and temporary. History has called America and our allies to action, 

and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom's fight.Our first priority must always be the security of 

our nation, and that will be reflected in the budget I send to Congress. My 

budget supports three great goals for America: We will win this war; we'll 

protect our homeland; and we will revive our economy.September the 11th brought out the best in 

America, and the best in this Congress. And I join the American people in 

applauding your unity and resolve. Now Americans deserve to have 

this same spirit directed toward addressing problems here at home. I'm a proud 

member of my party -- yet as we act to win the war, protect our people, and 

create jobs in America, we must act, first and foremost, not as Republicans, not 

as Democrats, but as Americans.It costs a lot to fight this war.  We have spent 

more than a billion dollars a month -- over $30 million a day -- and we must be 

prepared for future operations. Afghanistan proved that expensive precision 

weapons defeat the enemy and spare innocent lives, and we need more of them. We 

need to replace aging aircraft and make our military more agile, to put our 

troops anywhere in the world quickly and safely. Our men and women in uniform 

deserve the best weapons, the best equipment, the best training -- and they also 

deserve another pay raise.My budget includes the largest increase in 

defense spending in two decades -- because while the price of freedom and 

security is high, it is never too high. Whatever it costs to defend our 

country, we will pay.The next priority of my budget is to do 

everything possible to protect our citizens and strengthen our nation against 

the ongoing threat of another attack. Time and distance from the events of 

September the 11th will not make us safer unless we act on its lessons. America 

is no longer protected by vast oceans. We are protected from attack only by 

vigorous action abroad, and increased vigilance at home.My budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained 

strategy of homeland security, focused on four key areas: bioterrorism, 

emergency response, airport and border security, and improved intelligence.  We 

will develop vaccines to fight anthrax and other deadly diseases. We'll 

increase funding to help states and communities train and equip our heroic 

police and firefighters. We will improve intelligence collection 

and sharing, expand patrols at our borders, strengthen the security of air 

travel, and use technology to track the arrivals and departures of visitors to 

the United States.Homeland security will make America not only 

stronger, but, in many ways, better. Knowledge gained from bioterrorism 

research will improve public health. Stronger police and fire departments will 

mean safer neighborhoods. Stricter border enforcement will help combat illegal 

drugs. And as government works to better secure our homeland, 

America will continue to depend on the eyes and ears of alert citizens.A few days before Christmas, an airline flight 

attendant spotted a passenger lighting a match. The crew and passengers quickly 

subdued the man, who had been trained by al Qaeda and was armed with explosives. 

The people on that plane were alert and, as a result, likely saved nearly 200 

lives.  And tonight we welcome and thank flight attendants Hermis Moutardier and 

Christina Jones.Once we have funded our national security and our 

homeland security, the final great priority of my budget is economic security 

for the American people. To achieve these great national 

objectives -- to win the war, protect the homeland, and revitalize our economy 

-- our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short-term, so long as 

Congress restrains spending and acts in a fiscally responsible manner. 

We have clear priorities and we must act at home with the same 

purpose and resolve we have shown overseas: We'll prevail in the war, and we 

will defeat this recession.Americans who have lost their jobs need our help 

and I support extending unemployment benefits and direct assistance for health 

care coverage. Yet, American workers want more than unemployment 

checks -- they want a steady paycheck. When America works, America 

prospers, so my economic security plan can be summed up in one word:  jobs.Good jobs begin with good schools, and here we've 

made a fine start. Republicans and Democrats worked together to 

achieve historic education reform so that no child is left behind. I was proud 

to work with members of both parties: Chairman John Boehner and Congressman 

George Miller. Senator Judd Gregg. And I was so 

proud of our work, I even had nice things to say about my friend, Ted Kennedy. 

I know the folks at the Crawford coffee shop couldn't 

believe I'd say such a thing -- but our work on this bill shows 

what is possible if we set aside posturing and focus on results.There is more to do. We need to prepare our 

children to read and succeed in school with improved Head Start and early 

childhood development programs. We must upgrade our teacher 

colleges and teacher training and launch a major recruiting drive with a great 

goal for America: a quality teacher in every classroom.Good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable 

energy. This Congress must act to encourage conservation, promote technology, 

build infrastructure, and it must act to increase energy production at home so 

America is less dependent on foreign oil.Good jobs depend on expanded trade. Selling into 

new markets creates new jobs, so I ask Congress to finally approve trade 

promotion authority. On these two key issues, trade and energy, 

the House of Representatives has acted to create jobs, and I urge the Senate to 

pass this legislation.Good jobs depend on sound tax policy. 

Last year, some in this hall thought my tax relief plan was too 

small; some thought it was too big. But when the checks arrived in 

the mail, most Americans thought tax relief was just about right. Congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates, doubling 

the child credit, and ending the death tax.  For the sake of long-term growth 

and to help Americans plan for the future, let's make these tax cuts permanent.The way out of this recession, the way to create 

jobs, is to grow the economy by encouraging investment in factories and 

equipment, and by speeding up tax relief so people have more money to spend. 

For the sake of American workers, let's pass a stimulus package.Good jobs must be the aim of welfare reform. As 

we reauthorize these important reforms, we must always remember the goal is to 

reduce dependency on government and offer every American the dignity of a job.Americans know economic security can vanish in an 

instant without health security. I ask Congress to join me this year to enact a 

patients' bill of rights -- to give uninsured workers credits to 

help buy health coverage -- to approve an historic increase in the 

spending for veterans' health -- and to give seniors a sound and 

modern Medicare system that includes coverage for prescription drugs.A good job should lead to security in retirement. 

I ask Congress to enact new safeguards for 401K and pension plans. Employees who have worked hard and saved all their lives should not have to 

risk losing everything if their company fails. Through stricter 

accounting standards and tougher disclosure requirements, corporate America must 

be made more accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the highest 

standards of conduct.Retirement security also depends upon keeping the 

commitments of Social Security, and we will.  We must make Social Security 

financially stable and allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers 

who choose them.Members, you and I will work together in the 

months ahead on other issues:  productive farm policy -- a cleaner 

environment -- broader home ownership, especially among minorities 

-- and ways to encourage the good work of charities and 

faith-based groups. I ask you to join me on these important 

domestic issues in the same spirit of cooperation we've applied to our war 

against terrorism.During these last few months, I've been humbled 

and privileged to see the true character of this country in a time of testing. 

Our enemies believed America was weak and materialistic, that we would splinter 

in fear and selfishness. They were as wrong as they are evil.The American people have responded magnificently, 

with courage and compassion, strength and resolve.  As I have met the heroes, 

hugged the families, and looked into the tired faces of rescuers, I have stood 

in awe of the American people.And I hope you will join me -- I hope you will 

join me in expressing thanks to one American for the strength and calm and 

comfort she brings to our nation in crisis, our First Lady, Laura Bush.None of us would ever wish the evil that was done 

on September the 11th. Yet after America was attacked, it was as if our entire 

country looked into a mirror and saw our better selves. We were reminded that 

we are citizens, with obligations to each other, to our country, and to history. 

We began to think less of the goods we can accumulate, and more about the good 

we can do.For too long our culture has said, ""If it feels 

good, do it."" Now America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed: ""Let's 

roll."" In the sacrifice of soldiers, the fierce brotherhood of 

firefighters, and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens, we have 

glimpsed what a new culture of responsibility could look like. We want to be a 

nation that serves goals larger than self.  We've been offered a unique 

opportunity, and we must not let this moment pass.My call tonight is for every American to commit 

at least two years -- 4,000 hours over the rest of your lifetime -- to the 

service of your neighbors and your nation. Many are already 

serving, and I thank you.  If you aren't sure how to help, I've got a good place 

to start. To sustain and extend the best that has emerged in America, I invite 

you to join the new USA Freedom Corps. The Freedom Corps will focus on three 

areas of need: responding in case of crisis at home; rebuilding our 

communities; and extending American compassion throughout the world.One purpose of the USA Freedom Corps will be 

homeland security. America needs retired doctors and nurses who can be mobilized 

in major emergencies; volunteers to help police and fire departments; 

transportation and utility workers well-trained in spotting danger.Our country also needs citizens working to 

rebuild our communities. We need mentors to love children, especially children 

whose parents are in prison.  And we need more talented teachers in troubled 

schools. USA Freedom Corps will expand and improve the good efforts of AmeriCorps and Senior Corps to recruit more than 200,000 new volunteers.And America needs citizens to extend the 

compassion of our country to every part of the world.  So we will renew the 

promise of the Peace Corps, double its volunteers over the next five years -- 

and ask it to join a new effort to encourage development and 

education and opportunity in the Islamic world.This time of adversity offers a unique moment of 

opportunity -- a moment we must seize to change our culture.  Through the 

gathering momentum of millions of acts of service and decency and kindness, I 

know we can overcome evil with greater good. And we have a great 

opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the values that 

will bring lasting peace.All fathers and mothers, in all societies, want 

their children to be educated, and live free from poverty and violence. No 

people on Earth yearn to be oppressed, or aspire to servitude, or eagerly await 

the midnight knock of the secret police.If anyone doubts this, let them look to 

Afghanistan, where the Islamic ""street"" greeted the fall of tyranny with song 

and celebration. Let the skeptics look to Islam's own rich history, with its 

centuries of learning, and tolerance and progress. America will lead by 

defending liberty and justice because they are right and true and unchanging for 

all people everywhere.No nation owns these aspirations, and no nation 

is exempt from them. We have no intention of imposing our culture. But America 

will always stand firm for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity:  the 

rule of law; limits on the power of the state; respect for women; private 

property; free speech; equal justice; and religious tolerance.America will take the side of brave men and women 

who advocate these values around the world, including the Islamic world, because 

we have a greater objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment. 

We seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror.In this moment of opportunity, a common danger is 

erasing old rivalries. America is working with Russia and China and India, in 

ways we have never before, to achieve peace and prosperity.  In every region, 

free markets and free trade and free societies are proving their power to lift 

lives.  Together with friends and allies from Europe to Asia, and Africa to 

Latin America, we will demonstrate that the forces of terror cannot stop the 

momentum of freedom.The last time I spoke here, I expressed the hope 

that life would return to normal. In some ways, it has. In others, it never 

will.  Those of us who have lived through these challenging times have been 

changed by them. We've come to know truths that we will never question: evil 

is real, and it must be opposed. Beyond all differences of race or 

creed, we are one country, mourning together and facing danger together. Deep 

in the American character, there is honor, and it is stronger than cynicism. 

 And many have discovered again that even in tragedy -- especially in tragedy -- 

God is near.In a single instant, we realized that this will 

be a decisive decade in the history of liberty, that we've been called to a 

unique role in human events. Rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or 

consequential.Our enemies send other people's children on 

missions of suicide and murder. They embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a 

creed. We stand for a different choice, made long ago, on the day of our 

founding. We affirm it again today. We choose freedom and the dignity of every 

life.Steadfast in our purpose, we now press on. We 

have known freedom's price. We have shown freedom's power. And in this great 

conflict, my fellow Americans, we will see freedom's victory.Thank you all.

Anniversary of Cuban Independence Addressdelivered 20 May 
2002, James L. Knight Center, Miami, FloridaAudio mp3 of AddressPlug-in required for flash audioYour browser does not support the audio element.Thank you very much.Sientese. Voy a hablar en Espanol hoy pero no. No.  
		No quiero destruir un idioma que bonita, y por eso voy a hablar en 
		Ingles.  Thank you for having me. God bless you all and thanks for 
		coming.It is such an honor -- it is such an honor -- for me to be here today 
		with so many who love freedom.  One hundred years ago, a 
		proud island people declared independence and put Cuba on a democratic 
		course.  We're here today to celebrate this important 
		anniversary.  We are here today to honor the Cubans and 
		Cuban-Americans who strengthen America with their character and with 
		their enterprise.  We are here today -- we are here today to 
		proclaim loudly and clearly to the entire world -- the todos -- that the 
		Cuban people's love of liberty cannot -- and will not -- be denied.Not only today will we remind the world how much we love freedom, and 
		long for freedom, but I also want to talk about a proposal and a 
		challenge that will help put Cuba on the path to freedom.I want to thankmi hermano -- mi hermanito. Y el gran 
		gobernador de este estado. Thank you, Jeb. We love you.Y mi cunada bella.  I love being with my family. I love being with 
		my family. There's nothing more important than family in life, and I 
		love my brother, Jeb, a lot.I'm honored to be with a great American, a great American who is a 
		graduate of Pedro Pan, Mel Martinez, who brings a big difference in our 
		Cabinet.  I didn't realize Mel had that many cousins.I want to thank the two United States Senators from Florida for being 
		here, Senator Graham and Senator Nelson. I'm honored that you're here. 
		Thank you all for coming.  I appreciate working with Senator Graham 
		and his important job of chairing the Intelligence Committee in the 
		United States Senate.I want to thank two fine Congressmen, Ileana Ros y Lincoln Diaz-Balart.  I can't -- listen, every time I see and here Gloria Estefan 
		sing, it makes my heart feel better. Gloria, thank you.  And 
		it's good to see Emilio.  And I appreciate Jon Secada, as well. 
		Jon, you did a great job. Thank you very much. Honored you're here.I appreciate Vicki Huddleston, our Ambassador, Principal Officer at the 
		U.S. Interests Section in Havana, for being here. Vicki, thank you for 
		coming.  I'm honored to be traveling today with Otto Reich, 
		the Under Secretary for the State Department.  Dr. Elsa Murano is 
		here today, as well, who is in my Administration. Thank you, Elsa, for 
		being here. Where are you? Thank you -- appreciate you coming.Emilio Gonzalez, the Director of the Western Hemisphere Affairs of the 
		National Security Council -- where are you, Colonel? Emilio.  
		He's on my National Security Council. He reports directly to Arroz. 
		Senorita Arroz.Today, when I landed in Miami, I got off the airplane there and had a 
		chance to meet a young man named Emilio J. Rodriquez. Emilio is with us 
		today. Emilio, stand up for a second.  The reason I bring up 
		Emilio is I say oftentimes to Americans who want to -- how best they can 
		participate in our country, how best to fight evil is to do some good; 
		is to love a neighbor like you'd like to be loved yourself. If you're 
		interested, if you're interested in helping define our nation to the 
		world, and if you're interested in resisting evil, do some good. And 
		that's what Emilio does. He is a 19-year-old honor student at Miami-Dade 
		Community College. He volunteers in park cleanup programs. He does art 
		shows for children, and he hosts activities at a school for mentally 
		challenged Cuban-American children. For this, we're grateful for your 
		service.  Thank you for being here.The accomplished individuals I just named are just a small handful of 
		over a million fellow Americans from Cuban decent who make such an 
		incredibly important contribution to our country. So, as on the one 
		hand, we -- we celebrate independence, but we also celebrate the 
		greatness of America that opens her doors so that people can realize 
		their dreams.The success stories are unbelievable and unbelievably powerful. People 
		have escaped a jail and have come to America and have succeeded, and 
		have been able to raise their families, and have been able to prosper. 
		It's a wonderful part of the American story.But it's not just a story of the elderly and the older Cuban-Americans, 
		it's a story throughout generations. I want to talk about Miguel 
		Arguelles, who came to America in 1995, at age 10 years old.  
		At age 10, he couldn't speak English. A few weeks from now, he'll 
		graduate as the valedictorian of Miami Lake's Barbara Goleman Senior 
		High School.  He comes in 1995 -- he is going to be the first 
		person to have graduated from that high school to attend Harvard 
		University.I want to read what Miguel wrote in his application essay. And I want 
		all Americans, from all backgrounds, to listen to what this young man 
		said. He said he was born in a place where the sun shines brightest, and 
		drowns in tears; where Santa Claus has not the visa to enter, and dreams 
		cannot escape their prison of non-existence; where hopes are shattered, 
		and religion is an endangered species; where freedom is in shackles.I love how you put that. It's essential that -- Miguel, that you not 
		only succeed, but it's essential that we remember the shackles of 
		freedom that Miguel wrote about; that there are people whose lives are 
		being disrupted because Cuba is not free. I want to thank you for your 
		poignancy.And the shackles that this young man wrote about are an insult -- an 
		insult -- to the Cuban independence dreamed of by Felix Varela and 
		generations of Cuban patriots.  They're an insult. The shackles he 
		wrote about are an insult to Jose Marti, who sacrificed his life for a 
		great principle.No, we stand here today to declare loud and clear to the entire world: 
		Cuba must not only be independent, Cuba must be free.One hundred years ago Cuba declared her independence. And nearly 50 
		years ago, nearly a half-century ago, Cuba's independence and the hopes 
		for democracy were hijacked by a brutal dictator who cares everything 
		for his own power and nada for the Cuban people.In an era where markets have brought prosperity and empowerment, this 
		leader clings to a bankrupt ideology that has brought Cuba's workers and 
		farmers and families nothing -- nothing -- but isolation and misery.  
		I was amazed to read in this modern era, the Cuban regime banned the 
		sale of computers to the public. What does that tell you? In an era 
		where every other nation in our hemisphere has chosen the path to 
		democracy -- every nation in our hemisphere has chosen the path to 
		democracy -- this leader instead chooses to jail, to torture and exile 
		Cuban people for speaking their minds.But the amazing thing is, through all the pains, through all the pains, 
		the Cuban people's aspirations for freedom are undiminished. We see this 
		today in Havana, where more than 11,000 brave citizens have petitioned 
		their government for a referendum on basic freedoms. If that referendum 
		is allowed, it can be a prelude to real change in Cuba.This country has no designs on Cuba's sovereignty. We have no designs on 
		the sovereignty of Cuba. But we'll continue to be a strong and 
		consistent supporter of the Cuban people's aspirations for freedom.  
		And nowhere is that support stronger than right here in the streets of 
		Miami, Florida.  The support will never waive here, and it's not 
		going to waive in my heart, either.  For how long it takes -- after 
		all, we fight for freedom here in America. We love freedom. We love what 
		freedom means. It is the cornerstone of our country, and, therefore, we 
		will never stop in our search for ways to advance freedom in Cuba.Earlier today, in la Casa Blanca, I announced an initiative for a new 
		Cuba that offers Cuba's government a way forward, toward democracy and 
		hope and better relations with the United States. Cuba is scheduled to 
		hold elections to its National Assembly in 2003. I challenge Cuba's 
		government to make these elections free, and to make them fair.To make them free and fair, they must give opposition candidates the 
		freedom to organize, assemble and speak. They must give them the chance 
		to open up the airwaves, so they can get their message out to the 
		people.  To make them free and fair, they must release all 
		political prisoners so they can participate in the elections.In order to make sure we know if they're free and fair, they must let 
		human rights organizations into Cuba, to make sure that the elections 
		are free and fair. Once the 2003 elections are certified as free and 
		fair by international monitors, once Cuba begins the process of 
		meaningful economic reform, then -- and only then -- I will explore ways 
		with the United States Congress to ease economic sanctions.For 43 years, for 43 years, every election in Cuba has been a fraud and 
		a sham.  Mr. Castro, once, just once, show that you're unafraid of 
		a real election.  Show the world you respect Cuba's citizens enough 
		to listen to their voices, and to count their votes.  Start to 
		release your chokehold on the working people, and on enterprise. Then -- 
		and only then -- will we talk about easing sanctions, and not before.The goal of the United States, the goal of our policy towards Cuba is 
		not a permanent embargo on Cuba's economy; our goal is freedom for 
		Cuba's people.  Full normalization of relations with Cuba, 
		diplomatic recognition, open trade, and a robust aid program will only 
		-- only -- be possible when Cuba has a new government that is fully 
		democratic; when the rule of law is respected; and when the human rights 
		of all Cubans are protected.Under the new initiative for Cuba, under this new initiative for a new 
		Cuba, the United States recognizes that freedom sometimes grows step by 
		step, and we will encourage those steps. You need to know that I feel so 
		strongly about freedom. I mean, the current of history runs toward 
		freedom; eventually, it's not going to be denied. And our plan is to 
		accelerate freedom in Cuba in every way possible.We'll work to encourage freedom within Cuba by making life better for 
		people living under, and resisting the Castro regime.  So, 
		today I want to talk about some steps we can take, the beginning of some 
		important steps.My Administration will ease restrictions on humanitarian assistance from 
		legitimate U.S. religious and other non-governmental organizations that 
		directly serve the needs of the Cuban people, and to help build a Cuban 
		civil society.The United States will provide such groups with direct assistance that 
		can be used for humanitarian and entrepreneurial activities. Our 
		government will offer scholarships in the United States for Cuban 
		students and professionals who are trying to build independence civil 
		institutions. And we will offer scholarships to the children of 
		political prisoners.We're willing to negotiate direct mail service between the United States 
		and Cuba. My Administration will also continue to look for ways to 
		modernize Radio and TV Marti.These are beginning steps. We'll listen to the leaders in the community 
		for innovative ways to continue the inevitable march, and to hasten the 
		inevitable march toward freedom.Mr. Castro must now act. He has his chance. He's been given an 
		opportunity. We will continue to enforce economic sanctions and ban the 
		travel to Cuba until Cuba's government shows real reform.  
		And when we -- when I talk about economic reform -- 
		when I talk about economic reform, I mean real economic reform.The government must allow for workers to be able to organize in unions 
		outside of the control of the government.  The government must 
		respect private property.  Economic reform means the government 
		must allow employers to hire who they want to hire, as opposed to those 
		on a special list.  Economic reform means that when workers earn 
		hard currency, they get to keep the hard currency, as opposed to it 
		going to the Cuban government.We know what the Cuban government's up to. We trade in hard currency; 
		they pay in pesos and keep the difference. And therefore, without 
		meaningful reform, trade with Cuba would do nothing more than line the 
		pockets of Fidel Castro and his cronies.I say reform because we care about the people. We want to reform, insist 
		upon reform so the people will benefit. We hurt for the people in Cuba. 
		We long for a day when they realize the same freedoms we have here in 
		America. I want you to understand that I know what trade means with a 
		tyrant. It means that we will underwrite tyranny, and we cannot let that 
		happen. And I also want you to know I will not allow our taxpayers' 
		money to go to enrich the Castro regime. And I'm willing to use my veto.The initiative I've just -- the initiative I've outlined today offers 
		the Cuban government a way forward, a way towards democracy, a way 
		towards prosperity, a way towards respect. The choice now rests with Mr. 
		Castro.Audience Members:Boo!President Bush:If Mr. Castro does 
		not allow free elections he will be protecting his cronies at the 
		expense of his people.  And eventually -- and eventually -- despite 
		all his tools of oppression, Castro will need to answer to his people.Ten years before Cuba achieved independence, Jose Marti wrote this: If 
		our suffering homeland could see the care with which her absent children 
		are preparing to serve her, if our homeland could see the tenderness 
		with which she is loved by her children in exile, the joy of their faith 
		and her pride at once would give her the strength to break her chains at 
		last.Those words, written a long time ago, apply with equal power today. The 
		dream of a free and independent Cuba has been deferred, but it can never 
		be destroyed and it will not be denied.For those listening on Radio Marti, it's important for you to know the 
		United States stands with the Cuban people.  Not just on 
		Independence Day, but on every day. Every day.  Every day we 
		stand with those who reject tyranny and torture, and embrace liberty and 
		life. Every day we stand with the plantados in prison confronting 
		illegitimate power with righteous truth.  Every day we stand 
		with the Cuban families everywhere seeking a better future. Every day we 
		cultivate ""una rosa blanca"" for Cuba's freedom.Thank you all for coming.Viva Cuba libre!",ary cuban independence anniversary cuban independence addressdelivered may jam knight center miami

25,23 May 2002,>George W. Bush - On Compassionate Conservati,"Well, thank you very much for that warm welcome. I am so grateful for 
		the Commonwealth Club and the Churchill Club for inviting me here. I 
		appreciate you all coming, and I appreciate your hospitality.I want to thank Dr. Gloria Duffy for her generous introduction and for 
		her invitation. I want to thank Silvia Fernandez, who's the President of 
		the Churchill Club, for joining the Commonwealth Club to host this 
		event. I want to thank all the elected officials who are here. I want to 
		thank my fellow citizens for coming.Whenever I visit California, I'm impressed by the beauty of this state 
		and by the spirit of the people. Because of its size, the health of the 
		California economy influences every American. And California has got a 
		culture of optimism and energy that touches all of us, as well. This is 
		a vital and a vibrant place. And I'm glad to be back.The last time I visited San Jose, Silicon Valley was still in an 
		economic boom, and America was at peace. For many in this valley, and 
		across our country, those times are a world away. After a recession made 
		worse by a national emergency, we have seen some good news. Our economy 
		is beginning to grow. Just last week, we had the good news about strong 
		growth in the first quarter. Yet this vital region reminds us that a lot 
		of work remains to be done.Business investment and job creation are not what they should be. We 
		cannot be content with one quarter's news. We cannot be complacent. My 
		attitude is that we'll let the statisticians talk about the numbers. But 
		so long as somebody who wants to work can't find work, that's a problem 
		for America.We have a great task ahead of us. We must turn our short-term recovery 
		into long-lasting expansion that reaches every part of our country. Our 
		economy grows when trade barriers fall. I ask the Senate to join the 
		United States House of Representatives in giving me what's called trade 
		promotion authority.It's important to be a confident country. And I'm confident in the 
		ability of American entrepreneurs and producers to compete in the world. 
		I'm confident that our farmers and ranchers can compete in the world. 
		And I know American technology companies are the best in the world. And 
		we must open new markets so they can sell to the world.Our economy grows when the tax burden goes down, and stays down. Much of 
		the growth we have seen this quarter is the result of consumer spending, 
		fueled by well-timed tax deductions. (Laughter.) To encourage growth in 
		job creation, we must protect the lower tax rates we've enacted, and we 
		must make them permanent. And to make sure there is economic vitality 
		around our country, our government must control its appetite for 
		excessive spending.Our economy grows entrepreneurs are rewarded for their success, not 
		hounded by regulations and needless litigation. We must enact reforms 
		that free entrepreneurs from pointless regulation and endless 
		litigation, and to restore trust in our economy. Corporate leaders must 
		be held to the highest ethical standards. And, as your state knows, our 
		economy grows when we have steady, stable and affordable sources of 
		energy.In Washington, we must adopt -- finally adopt -- a comprehensive 
		strategy to conserve more, to produce more, and to deliver the energy 
		that keeps our economy running. Both Houses have passed an energy -- 
		passed energy legislation. I expect them to get a bill to my desk soon 
		for the good of American economy and American jobs. By acting in the 
		above way, we confirm that the role of government is not to create 
		wealth; the role of government is to create the conditions for economic 
		growth.Since I was last here, America has also accepted a great challenge in 
		the world: to wage a relentless and systematic campaign against global 
		terror. The security of the American people is the central commitment of 
		the American government. We are in for a long and difficult war. It will 
		be conducted on many fronts. But as long as it takes, we will prevail.In the first phase of our military operation, American and coalition 
		forces have liberated -- have liberated -- the people of Afghanistan 
		from a barbaric regime. Our Armed Forces performed with skill and 
		success and honor. A regime has fallen. Terrorists in that country are 
		now scattered, and the children of Afghanistan have returned to school, 
		boys and girls. Our work in that country is not over. We are helping the 
		Afghan people to rebuild their nation. And in every cave, in every dark 
		corner of that country, we will hunt down the killers and bring them to 
		justice.We have entered the next phase of the war, with a sustained 
		international effort, to rout out terrorists in other countries, and 
		deny al Qaeda the chance to regroup in other places. Across the world, 
		governments have heard this message: You're either with us, or you're 
		with the terrorists.And for the long-term security of America and civilization itself, we 
		must confront the great threat of biological and chemical and nuclear 
		weapons in the hands of terrorists or hostile regimes. We will not allow 
		the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten America or our friends 
		and allies with the world's most destructive weapons.History has called us to these responsibilities, and we accept them. 
		America has always had a special mission to defend justice and advance 
		freedom around the world. Whatever the difficulties ahead, we are 
		confident about the outcome of this struggle. Tyranny and terror and 
		lawless violence will not decide the world's future. As Ronald Reagan 
		said. and as every generation of Americans has believed, the future 
		belongs to the free.In a time of war, we reassert the essential values and beliefs of our 
		country. In the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln pointed toward a new birth of 
		freedom. Leading America into global war, Franklin D. Roosevelt defined 
		the four freedoms: freedom of speech and religion, freedom from fear and 
		want. Whenever America fights for the security of our country, we also 
		fight for the values of our country. In our time, we will defend the 
		land we love and we will act on the ideals that gave it birth.In America, we've not always lived up to our ideals, yet we always 
		reached for them. We believe that everyone deserves a chance, that 
		everyone has value, that no insignificant person was ever born. We 
		believe that all are diminished when any are hopeless. We are one 
		people, committed to building a single nation of justice and 
		opportunity.America rejects bigotry. We reject every act of hatred against people of 
		Arab background or Muslim faith. We reject the ancient evil of 
		anti-Semitism, whether it is practiced by the killers of Daniel Pearl, 
		or by those who burn synagogues in France.America values and welcomes peaceful people of all faiths -- Christian, 
		Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu and many others. Every faith is practiced 
		and protected here, because we are one country. Every immigrant can be 
		fully and equally American because we're one country. Race and color 
		should not divide us, because America is one country.These American ideals of opportunity and equality come to us across the 
		generations. And they have attracted millions from across the world. Yet 
		there are young Americans growing up here, under this flag, who doubt 
		the promise and justice of our country. They live in neighborhoods 
		occupied by gangs and ruled by fear. They are entitled by law to an 
		education, yet do not receive an education. They hear talk of 
		opportunity and see little evidence of opportunity around them.Every American must believe in the promise of America. And to reach this 
		noble, necessary goal, there is a role for government. America doesn't 
		need more big government, and we've learned that more money is not 
		always the answer. If a program is failing to serve people, it makes 
		little difference if we spend twice as much or half as much. The measure 
		of true compassion is results.Yet we cannot have an indifferent government either. We are a generous 
		and caring people. We don't believe in a sink-or-swim society. The 
		policies of our government must heed the universal call of all faiths to 
		love a neighbor as we would want to be loved ourselves. We need a 
		different approach than either big government or indifferent government. 
		We need a government that is focused, effective, and close to the 
		people; a government that does a few things, and does them well.Government cannot solve every problem, but it can encourage people and 
		communities to help themselves and to help one another. Often the truest 
		kind of compassion is to help citizens build lives of their own. I call 
		my philosophy and approach ""compassionate conservatism."" It is 
		compassionate to actively help our fellow citizens in need. It is 
		conservative to insist on responsibility and on results. And with this 
		hopeful approach, we can make a real difference in people's lives.Compassionate conservatism places great hope and confidence in public 
		education. Our economy depends on higher and higher skills, requiring 
		every American to have the basic tools of learning. Every public school 
		should be the path of upward mobility.Yet, sadly enough, many are the dead-end of dreams. Public schools are 
		some of the most important institutions of democracy. They take children 
		of every background, from every part of the world, and prepare them for 
		the obligations and opportunities of a free society. Public schools are 
		Americans great hope, and making them work for every child is America's 
		great duty.The new education reforms we have passed in Washington give the federal 
		government a new role in public education. Schools must meet new and 
		high standards of performance in reading and math that will be proven on 
		tests and posted on the Internet for parents and everyone to see. And 
		we're giving local schools and teachers unprecedented freedom and 
		resources and training to meet these goals.It is conservative to let local communities chart their own path to 
		excellence. It is compassionate to insist that every child learns, so 
		that no child is left behind. By insisting on results, and challenging 
		failure where we find it, we'll make an incredible difference in the 
		lives of every child in America.Compassionate conservatism offers a new vision for fighting poverty in 
		America. For decades, our nation has devoted enormous resources to 
		helping the poor, with some great successes to show for it: basic 
		medical care for those in need, a better life for elderly Americans. 
		However, for millions of younger Americans, welfare became a static and 
		destructive way of life.In 1996, we began transforming welfare with time limits and job training 
		and work requirements. And the nation's welfare rolls have been cut by 
		more than half. But even more importantly, many lives have been 
		dramatically improved.One former welfare recipient here in California, happened to be a mother 
		of a chronically-ill child and the victim of domestic violence, 
		describes her experience upon leaving welfare. She said, ""I feel like an 
		adult again. I have my dignity back.""We need to continue to fully transform welfare in America. As Congress 
		takes up welfare reform again in the coming weeks, we must strengthen 
		the work requirements that prevent dependency and despair. Millions of 
		Americans once on welfare are finding that a job is more than a source 
		of income. It is a source of dignity. And by helping people find work, 
		by helping them prepare for work, we practice compassion.Welfare reform must also, wherever possible, encourage the commitments 
		of family. Not every child has two devoted parents at home -- I 
		understand that. And not every marriage can, or should be saved. But the 
		evidence shows that strong marriages are good for children.When a couple on welfare wants to break bad patterns and start or 
		strengthen a marriage, we should help local groups give them counseling 
		that teaches commitment and respect. By encouraging family, we practice 
		compassion.In overcoming poverty and dependence, we must also promote the work of 
		charities and community groups and faith-based institutions. These 
		organizations, such as shelters for battered women or mentoring programs 
		for fatherless children or drug treatment centers, inspire hope in a way 
		that government never can. Often, they inspire life-changing faith in a 
		way that government never should.Our government should view the good Americans that work in faith-based 
		charities as partners, not rivals. We must provide new incentives for 
		charitable giving and, when it comes to providing federal resources to 
		effective programs, we should not discriminate against private and 
		religious groups.I urge the Senate to pass the faith-based initiative for the good of 
		America. It is compassionate to aggressively fight poverty in America. 
		It is conservative to encourage work and community spirit and 
		responsibility and the values that often come from faith. And with this 
		approach, we can change lives one soul at a time, and make a real 
		difference in the lives of our citizens.The same principles of compassion and responsibility apply when America 
		offers assistance to other nations. Nearly half of the world's people 
		still live on less than $2 a day. When we help them, we show our values, 
		our belief in universal human dignity. We serve our interests and gain 
		economic partners. And by helping the developing nations of the world, 
		we offer an alternative to resentment and conflict and terror.Yet the old way of pouring vast amounts of money into development aid 
		without any concern for results has failed, often leaving behind misery 
		and poverty and corruption. America's offering a new compact for global 
		development. Greater aid contributions from America must be and will be 
		linked to greater responsibility from developing nations.I have proposed a 50-percent increase in our core development assistance 
		over the next three budget years. Money that will be placed in a new 
		Millennium Challenge Account. At the end of this three-year period, the 
		level of our annual development assistance will be $5 billion higher 
		than current levels.This is a record amount of spending. And in return for these funds, we 
		expect nations to rout out corruption, to open their markets, to respect 
		human rights, and to adhere to the rule of law. And these are the keys 
		to progress in any nation, and they will be the conditions for any new 
		American aid.It is compassionate to increase our international aid. It is 
		conservative to require the hard reforms that lead to prosperity and 
		independence. And with this approach, we'll make a real difference in 
		the lives of people around the world.Compassionate conservatism guides my administration in many other areas. 
		Our health care policies must help low-income Americans to buy health 
		insurance they choose, they own and they control. Our environmental 
		policy set high standards for stewardship, while allowing local 
		cooperation and innovation to meet those standards. Our housing programs 
		moved beyond rental assistance to the pride and stability of home 
		ownership. Our reforms in Social Security must allow and encourage and 
		help working Americans to build up their own asset base and achieve 
		independence for their retirement years.All of these policies and all of these areas serve the same vision. We 
		are using an active government to promote self-government. We're 
		encouraging individuals and communities and families to take more and 
		more responsibility for themselves, for their neighbors, for our nation. 
		The aim of these policies is not to spend more money or spend less 
		money; it is to spend on what works.The measure of compassion is more than good intentions, it is good 
		results. Sympathy is not enough. We need solutions in America, and we 
		know where solutions are found. When schools are teaching, when families 
		are strong, when neighbors look after their neighbors, when our people 
		have the tools and the skills and the resources they need to improve 
		their lives, there is no problem that cannot be solved in America.By being involved and by taking responsibility upon ourselves, we gain 
		something else, as well: We contribute to the life of our country. We 
		become more than taxpayers and occasional voters, we become citizens. 
		Citizens, not spectators. Citizens who hear the call of duty, who stand 
		up for their beliefs, who care for their families, who control their 
		lives, and who treat their neighbors with respect and compassion. We 
		discover a satisfaction that is only found in service, and we show our 
		gratitude to America and to those who came before us.In the last seven months, we've been tested, and the struggle of our 
		time has revealed the spirit of our people. Since September the 11th, we 
		have been the kind of nation our founders had in mind, a nation of 
		strong and confident and self-governing people. And we've been the kind 
		of nation our fathers and mothers defended in World War II; a great and 
		diverse country, united by common dangers and by common resolve.We in our time will defend our nation, and we will deliver our nation's 
		promise to all who seek it. In our war on terror, we are showing the 
		world the strength of our country, and by our unity and tolerance and 
		compassion, we will show the world the soul of our country.May God bless America.",well thank much warm welcome grateful commonwealth club churchill club invite appreciate come appreciate want thank

26,01 June 2002,>George W. Bush Bundestag Speech (text-vide,"(text-video)GeorgeW.BushAddress to the German Federal Parliamentdelivered 23 May 
2002, Berlin, GermanyPresident, thank you very much for your kind 
introduction. And thank you for giving me this chance to be here today. 
President Rau, thank you very much; Chancellor Schroeder. I understand former 
Chancellor Kohl is here. I want to thank the members of the Bundestag. How are 
you, sir?I was a little nervous when the President told me that you all are on vacation.  I can just imagine how my Congress would react if I called them back 
to hear a speech of mine when they were on vacation.  But thank you 
for coming. I'm so honored to be here. And my wife, Laura, and I really 
appreciate the hospitality that you've shown us.I've had the pleasure of welcoming your Chancellor to Washington three times, 
and we have established a strong relationship. Mr. Chancellor, I'm grateful.And now I am honored to visit this great city. The history of our time is 
written in the life of Berlin. In this building, fires of hatred were set that 
swept across the world. To this city, Allied planes brought food and hope during 
323 days and nights of siege. Across an infamous divide, men and women jumped 
from tenement buildings and crossed through razor wire to live in freedom or to 
die in the attempt. One American President came here to proudly call himself a 
citizen of Berlin. Another President dared the Soviets to ""tear down that wall."" 
And on a night in November, Berliners took history into their hands, and made 
your city whole.In a single lifetime, the people of this capital and this country endured 12 
years of dictatorial rule, suffered 40 years of bitter separation, and 
persevered through this challenging decade of unification. For all these trials, 
Germany has emerged a responsible, a prosperous and peaceful nation. More than a 
decade ago, as the President pointed out, my father spoke of Germany and America 
as partners in leadership -- and this has come to pass. A new era has arrived -- 
the strong Germany you have built is good for the world.On both sides of the Atlantic, the generation of our fathers was called to shape 
great events -- and they built the great transatlantic alliance of democracies. 
They built the most successful alliance in history. After The Cold War, during 
the relative quiet of the 1990s, some questioned whether our transatlantic 
partnership still had a purpose. History has given its answer. Our generation 
faces new and grave threats to liberty, to the safety of our people, and to 
civilization, itself. We face an aggressive force that glorifies death, that 
targets the innocent, and seeks the means to matter -- murder on a massive 
scale.We face the global tragedy of disease and poverty that take uncounted lives and 
leave whole nations vulnerable to oppression and terror.We'll face these challenges together. We must face them together. Those who 
despise human freedom will attack it on every continent. Those who seek missiles 
and terrible weapons are also familiar with the map of Europe. Like the threats 
of another era, this threat cannot be appeased or cannot be ignored. By being 
patient, relentless, and resolute, we will defeat the enemies of freedom.By remaining united --[Audience interruption.]President Bush:By remaining united, we are 
meeting -- we are meeting modern threats with the greatest resources of wealth 
and will ever assembled by free nations. Together, Europe and the United States 
have the creative genius, the economic power, the moral heritage, and the 
democratic vision to protect our liberty and to advance our cause of peace.Different as we are, we are building and defending the same house of freedom -- 
its doors open to all of Europe's people, its windows looking out to global 
challenges beyond. We must lay the foundation with a Europe that is whole and 
free and at peace for the first time in its history. This dream of the centuries 
is close at hand.From the Argonne Forest to the Anzio beachhead, conflicts in Europe have drawn 
the blood of millions, squandering and shattering lives across the earth. There 
are thousands, thousands of monuments in parks and squares across my country to 
young men of 18 and 19 and 20 whose lives ended in battle on this continent. 
Ours is the first generation in a hundred years that does not expect and does 
not fear the next European war. And that achievement -- your achievement -- is 
one of the greatest in modern times.When Europe grows in unity, Europe and America grow in security. When you 
integrate your markets and share a currency in the European Union, you are 
creating the conditions for security and common purpose. In all these steps, 
Americans do not see the rise of a rival, we see the end of old hostilities. We 
see the success of our allies, and we applaud your progress.The expansion of NATO will also extend the security on this continent, 
especially for nations that knew little peace or security in the last century. 
We have moved cautiously in this direction. Now we must act decisively.As our summit in Prague approaches, America is committed to NATO membership for 
all of Europe's democracies that are ready to share in the responsibilities that 
NATO brings. Every part of Europe should share in the security and success of 
this continent. A broader alliance will strengthen NATO -- it will fulfill 
NATO's promise.Another mission we share is to encourage the Russian people to find their future 
in Europe, and with America. Russia has its best chance since 1917 to become a 
part of Europe's family. Russia's transformation is not finished; the outcome is 
not yet determined. But for all the problems and challenges, Russia is moving 
toward freedom -- more freedom in its politics and its markets; freedom that 
will help Russia to act as a great and a just power. A Russia at peace with its 
neighbors, respecting the legitimate rights of minorities, is welcome in Europe.A new Russian-American partnership is being forged. Russia is lending crucial 
support in the war on global terror. A Russian colonel now works on the staff of 
U.S. Army General Tommy Franks, commander of the war in Afghanistan. And in 
Afghanistan, itself, Russia is helping to build hospitals and a better future 
for the Afghan people.America and Europe must throw off old suspicions and realize our common 
interests with Russia. Tomorrow in Moscow, President Putin and I will again act 
upon these interests.The United States and Russia are ridding ourselves of the last vestiges of cold 
War confrontation. We have moved beyond an ABM treaty that prevented us from 
defending our people and our friends. Some warned that moving beyond the ABM 
treaty would cause an arms race. Instead, President Putin and I are about to 
sign the most dramatic nuclear arms reduction in history. Both the United States 
and Russia will reduce our nuclear arsenals by about two-thirds -- to the lowest 
levels in decades.Old arms agreements sought to manage hostility and maintain a balance of terror. 
This new agreement recognizes that Russia and the West are no longer enemies.The entire transatlantic alliance is forming a new relationship with Russia. 
Next week in Rome, Chancellor Schroeder, NATO allies, and I will meet as equal 
partners with President Putin at the creation of the NATO-Russia Council. The 
Council gives us an opportunity to build common security against common threats. 
We will start with projects on nonproliferation, counterterrorism, and 
search-and-rescue operations. Over time, we will expand this cooperation, even 
as we preserve the core mission of NATO. Many generations have looked at Russia 
with alarm. Our generation can finally lift this shadow from Europe by embracing 
the friendship of a new democratic Russia.As we expand our alliance, as we reach out to Russia, we must also look beyond 
Europe to gathering dangers and important responsibilities. As we build the 
house of freedom, we must meet the challenges of a larger world. And we must 
meet them together.For the United States, September the 11th, 2001 cut a deep dividing line in our 
history -- a change of eras as sharp and clear as Pearl Harbor, or the first day 
of the Berlin Blockade. There can be no lasting security in a world at the mercy 
of terrorists -- for my nation, or for any nation.Given this threat, NATO's defining purpose -- our collective defense -- is as 
urgent as ever. America and Europe need each other to fight and win the war 
against global terror. My nation is so grateful for the sympathy of the German 
people, and for the strong support of Germany and all of Europe.Troops from more than a dozen European countries have deployed in and around 
Afghanistan, including thousands from this country -- the first deployment of 
German forces outside of Europe since 1945. German soldiers have died in this 
war, and we mourn their loss as we do our own. German authorities are on the 
trail of terrorist cells and finances. And German police are helping Afghans 
build their own police force. And we're so grateful for the support.Together, we oppose an enemy that thrives on violence and the grief of the 
innocent. The terrorists are defined by their hatreds: they hate democracy and 
tolerance and free expression and women and Jews and Christians and all Muslims 
who disagree with them. Others killed in the name of racial purity, or the class 
struggle. These enemies kill in the name of a false religious purity, perverting 
the faith they claim to hold. In this war we defend not just America or Europe; 
we are defending civilization, itself.The evil that has formed against us has been termed the ""new totalitarian 
threat."" The authors of terror are seeking nuclear, chemical and biological 
weapons. Regimes that sponsor terror are developing these weapons and the 
missiles to deliver them. If these regimes and their terrorist allies were to 
perfect these capabilities, no inner voice of reason, no hint of conscience 
would prevent their use.Wishful thinking might bring comfort, but not security. Call this a strategic 
challenge; call it, as I do, axis of evil; call it by any name you choose, but 
let us speak the truth. If we ignore this threat, we invite certain blackmail, 
and place millions of our citizens in grave danger.Our response will be reasoned, and focused, and deliberate. We will use more 
than our military might. We will cut off terrorist finances, apply diplomatic 
pressure, and continue to share intelligence. America will consult closely with 
our friends and allies at every stage. But make no mistake about it, we will and 
we must confront this conspiracy against our liberty and against our lives.As it faces new threats, NATO needs a new strategy and new capabilities. Dangers 
originating far from Europe can now strike at Europe's heart -- so NATO must be 
able and willing to act whenever threats emerge. This will require all the 
assets of modern defense -- mobile and deployable forces, sophisticated special 
operations, the ability to fight under the threat of chemical and biological 
weapons. Each nation must focus on the military strengths it can bring to this 
alliance, with the hard choices and financial commitment that requires. We do 
not know where the next threat might come from, we really don't know what form 
it might take. But we must be ready, as full military partners, to confront 
threats to our common security.One way to make ourselves more secure is to 
address the regional conflicts that enflame violence. Our work in the Balkans 
and Afghanistan shows how much we can achieve when we stand together. We must 
continue to stand for peace in the Middle East. That peace must assure the 
permanent safety of the Jewish people. And that peace must provide the 
Palestinian people with a state of their own.In the midst of terrorist violence in the Middle East, the hope of a lasting 
accord may seem distant. That's how many once viewed the prospect of peace 
between Poland and Germany, Germany and France, France and England, Protestant 
and Catholic. Yet, after generations of traded violence and humiliation, we have 
seen enemies become partners and allies in a new Europe. We pray the same 
healing, the same shedding of hatred, might come to the Middle East. And we will 
be unrelenting in our quest for that peace.We must recognize that violence and resentment are defeated by the advance of 
health, and learning, and prosperity. Poverty doesn't create terror -- yet, 
terror takes root in failing nations that cannot police themselves or provide 
for their people. Our conscience and our interests speak as one: to achieve a 
safer world, we must create a better world.The expansion of trade in our time is one of the primary reasons for our 
progress against poverty. At Doha, we committed to build on this progress, and 
we must keep that commitment. Trans-Atlantic nations must resolve the small, 
disputed portion of our vast trading relationship within the rules and 
settlement mechanisms of the World Trade Organization -- whether those disputes 
concern tax law, steel, agricultural or biotechnology.For all nations -- for all nations to gain the benefit of global markets, they 
need populations that are healthy and literate. To help developing nations 
achieve these goals, leaders of wealthy nations have a duty of conscience -- We 
have a duty to share our wealth generously and wisely. Those who lead poor 
nations have a duty to their own people -- but they have a duty as well: to 
pursue reforms that turn temporary aid into lasting progress.I've proposed that new American aid be directed to nations on that path of 
reform. The United States will increase our core development assistance by 50 
percent over the next three budget years. It will be up to a level of $5 billion 
a year, above and beyond that which we already contribute to development.When nations are governed justly, the people benefit. When nations are governed 
unjustly, for the benefit of a corrupt few, no amount of aid will help the 
people in need. When nations are governed justly -- when nations are governed 
justly, investing in education and health, and encouraging economic freedom, 
they will have our help. And more importantly, these rising nations will have 
their own ability and, eventually, the resources necessary to battle disease and 
improve their environment, and build lives of dignity for their people.Members of the Bundestag, we are joined in serious purpose -- very serious 
purposes -- on which the safety of our people and the fate of our freedom now 
rest. We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. The 
magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small. 
And those who exaggerate our differences play a shallow game and hold a 
simplistic view of our relationship.America and the nations in Europe are more than military allies, we're more than 
trading partners; we are heirs to the same civilization. The pledges of the 
Magna Carta, the learning of Athens, the creativity of Paris, the unbending 
conscience of Luther, the gentle faith of St. Francis -- all of these are part 
of the American soul. The New World has succeeded by holding to the values of 
the Old.Our histories have diverged, yet we seek to live by the same ideals. We believe 
in free markets, tempered by compassion. We believe in open societies that 
reflect unchanging truths. We believe in the value and dignity of every life.These convictions bind our civilization together 
and set our enemies against us. These convictions are universally true and 
right. And they define our nations and our partnership in a unique way. And 
these beliefs lead us to fight tyranny and evil, as others have done before us.One of the greatest Germans of the 20th century wasPastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer-- who left the 
security of America to stand against Nazi rule. In a dark hour, he gave witness 
to the Gospel of life, and paid the cost of his discipleship, being put to death 
only days before his camp was liberated.""I believe,"" said Bonhoeffer, ""that God can and wants to create good out of 
everything, even evil.""That belief is proven in the history of Europe since that day -- in the 
reconciliation and renewal that have transformed this continent. In America, 
very recently, we have also seen the horror of evil and the power of good. In 
the tests of our time, we are affirming our deepest values and our closest 
friendships. Inside this chamber, across this city, throughout this nation and 
continent, America has valued friends. And with our friends we are building that 
house of freedom -- for our time and for all time.May God bless.Original Text and Image Source:georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/Page Updated:12/27/19U.S. Copyright Status:Text and Image =Public

for pdfThank you very much, General Lennox. Mr. Secretary, Governor Pataki, 
		members of the United States Congress, Academy staff and faculty, 
		distinguished guests, proud family members, and graduates:I want to 
		thank you for your welcome. Laura and I are especially honored to visit 
		this great institution in your bicentennial year.In every corner of America, the words ""West Point"" command immediate 
		respect. This place where the Hudson River bends is more than a fine 
		institution of learning. The United States Military Academy is the 
		guardian of values that have shaped the soldiers who have shaped the 
		history of the world.A few of you have followed in the path of the perfect West Point 
		graduate, Robert E. Lee, who never received a single demerit in four 
		years. Some of you followed in the path of the imperfect graduate, 
		Ulysses S. Grant, who had his fair share of demerits, and said the 
		happiest day of his life was ""the day I left West Point.""  
		During my college years I guess you could say I was -- During my college 
		years I guess you could say I was a Grant man.You walk in the tradition of Eisenhower and MacArthur, Patton and 
		Bradley - the commanders who saved a civilization. And you walk in the 
		tradition of second lieutenants who did the same, by fighting and dying 
		on distant battlefields.Graduates of this academy have brought creativity and courage to every 
		field of endeavor. West Point produced the chief engineer of the Panama 
		Canal, the mind behind the Manhattan Project, the first American to walk 
		in space. This fine institution gave us the man they say invented 
		baseball, and other young men over the years who perfected the game of 
		football.You know this, but many in America don't -- George C. Marshall, a VMI 
		graduate, is said to have given this order: ""I want an officer for a 
		secret and dangerous mission. I want a West Point football player.""As you leave here today, I know there's one thing you'll never miss 
		about this place: Being a plebe. But even a plebe at West 
		Point is made to feel he or she has some standing in the world.  
		I'm told that plebes, when asked whom they outrank, are required to 
		answer this: ""Sir, the Superintendent's dog -- the Commandant's cat, and 
		all the admirals in the whole damn Navy."" I probably won't be sharing 
		that with the Secretary of the Navy.West Point is guided by tradition, and in honor of the ""Golden Children 
		of the Corps,"" -- I will observe one of the traditions you 
		cherish most. As the Commander-in-Chief, I hereby grant amnesty to all 
		cadets who are on restriction for minor conduct offenses. Those of you in the end zone might have cheered a little early.  
		Because, you see, I'm going to let General Lennox define exactly what 
		""minor"" means.Every West Point class is commissioned to the Armed Forces. Some West 
		Point classes are also commissioned by history, to take part in a great 
		new calling for their country. Speaking here to the class of 1942 -- six 
		months after Pearl Harbor -- General Marshall said, ""We're determined 
		that before the sun sets on this terrible struggle, our flag will be 
		recognized throughout the world as a symbol of freedom on the one hand, 
		and of overwhelming power on the other.""Officers graduating that year helped fulfill that mission, defeating 
		Japan and Germany, and then reconstructing those nations as allies. West 
		Point graduates of the 1940s saw the rise of a deadly new challenge -- 
		the challenge of imperial communism -- and opposed it from Korea to 
		Berlin, to Vietnam, and in the Cold War, from beginning to end. And as 
		the sun set on their struggle, many of those West Point officers lived 
		to see a world transformed.History has also issued its call to your generation. In your last year, 
		America was attacked by a ruthless and resourceful enemy. You graduate 
		from this Academy in a time of war, taking your place in an American 
		military that is powerful and is honorable. Our war on terror is only 
		begun, but in Afghanistan it was begun well.I am proud of the men and women who have fought on my orders. America is 
		profoundly grateful for all who serve the cause of freedom, and for all 
		who have given their lives in its defense. This nation respects and 
		trusts our military, and we are confident in your victories to come.This war will take many turns we cannot predict. Yet I am certain of 
		this: Wherever we carry it, the American flag will stand not only for 
		our power, but for freedom.  Our nation's cause has always 
		been larger than our nation's defense. We fight, as we always fight, for 
		a just peace -- a peace that favors human liberty. We will defend the 
		peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the 
		peace by building good relations among the great powers. And we will 
		extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every 
		continent.Building this just peace is America's opportunity, and America's duty. 
		From this day forward, it is your challenge, as well, and we will meet 
		this challenge together.  You will wear the uniform of a 
		great and unique country. America has no empire to extend or utopia to 
		establish. We wish for others only what we wish for ourselves -- safety 
		from violence, the rewards of liberty, and the hope for a better life.In defending the peace, we face a threat with no precedent. Enemies in 
		the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to 
		endanger the American people and our nation. The attacks of September 
		the 11th required a few hundred thousand dollars in the hands of a few 
		dozen evil and deluded men. All of the chaos and suffering they caused 
		came at much less than the cost of a single tank. The dangers have not 
		passed. This government and the American people are on watch, we are 
		ready, because we know the terrorists have more money and more men and 
		more plans.The gravest danger to freedom lies at the perilous crossroads of 
		radicalism and technology. When the spread of chemical and biological 
		and nuclear weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when 
		that occurs, even weak states and small groups could attain a 
		catastrophic power to strike great nations. Our enemies have declared 
		this very intention, and have been caught seeking these terrible 
		weapons. They want the capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to 
		harm our friends -- and we will oppose them with all our power.For much of the last century, America's defense relied on the Cold War 
		doctrines of deterrence and containment. In some cases, those strategies 
		still apply. But new threats also require new thinking. Deterrence -- 
		the promise of massive retaliation against nations -- means nothing 
		against shadowy terrorist networks with no nation or citizens to defend. 
		Containment is not possible when unbalanced dictators with weapons of 
		mass destruction can deliver those weapons on missiles or secretly 
		provide them to terrorist allies.We cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. We 
		cannot put our faith in the word of tyrants, who solemnly sign 
		non-proliferation treaties, and then systemically break them. If we wait 
		for threats to fully materialize, we will have waited too long.Homeland defense and missile defense are part of stronger security, and 
		they're essential priorities for America. Yet the war on terror will not 
		be won on the defensive. We must take the battle to the enemy, disrupt 
		his plans, and confront the worst threats before they emerge.  In 
		the world we have entered, the only path to safety is the path of 
		action. And this nation will act.Our security will require the best intelligence, to reveal threats 
		hidden in caves and growing in laboratories. Our security will require 
		modernizing domestic agencies such as the FBI, so they're prepared to 
		act, and act quickly, against danger. Our security will require 
		transforming the military you will lead -- a military that must be ready 
		to strike at a moment's notice in any dark corner of the world. And our 
		security will require all Americans to be forward-looking and resolute, 
		to be ready for preemptive action when necessary to defend our liberty 
		and to defend our lives.The work ahead is difficult. The choices we will face are complex. We 
		must uncover terror cells in 60 or more countries, using every tool of 
		finance, intelligence and law enforcement. Along with our friends and 
		allies, we must oppose proliferation and confront regimes that sponsor 
		terror, as each case requires. Some nations need military training to 
		fight terror, and we'll provide it. Other nations oppose terror, but 
		tolerate the hatred that leads to terror -- and that must change.  
		We will send diplomats where they are needed, and we will send you, our 
		soldiers, where you're needed.All nations that decide for aggression and terror will pay a price. We 
		will not leave the safety of America and the peace of the planet at the 
		mercy of a few mad terrorists and tyrants.  We will lift this 
		dark threat from our country and from the world.Because the war on terror will require resolve and patience, it will 
		also require firm moral purpose. In this way our struggle is similar to 
		the Cold War. Now, as then, our enemies are totalitarians, holding a 
		creed of power with no place for human dignity. Now, as then, they seek 
		to impose a joyless conformity, to control every life and all of life.America confronted imperial communism in many different ways -- 
		diplomatic, economic, and military. Yet moral clarity was essential to 
		our victory in the Cold War. When leaders like John F. Kennedy and 
		Ronald Reagan refused to gloss over the brutality of tyrants, they gave 
		hope to prisoners and dissidents and exiles, and rallied free nations to 
		a great cause.Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the 
		language of right and wrong. I disagree.  Different 
		circumstances require different methods, but not different moralities.  Moral truth is the same in every culture, in every time, and 
		in every place. Targeting innocent civilians for murder is always and 
		everywhere wrong.  Brutality against women is always and 
		everywhere wrong.  There can be no neutrality between justice 
		and cruelty, between the innocent and the guilty. We are in a conflict 
		between good and evil, and America will call evil by its name.  By 
		confronting evil and lawless regimes, we do not create a problem, we 
		reveal a problem. And we will lead the world in opposing it.As we defend the peace, we also have an historic opportunity to preserve 
		the peace. We have our best chance since the rise of the nation state in 
		the 17th century to build a world where the great powers compete in 
		peace instead of prepare for war. The history of the last century, in 
		particular, was dominated by a series of destructive national rivalries 
		that left battlefields and graveyards across the Earth. Germany fought 
		France, the Axis fought the Allies, and then the East fought the West, 
		in proxy wars and tense standoffs, against a backdrop of nuclear 
		Armageddon.Competition between great nations is inevitable, but armed conflict in 
		our world is not. More and more, civilized nations find ourselves on the 
		same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos. 
		America has, and intends to keep, military strengths beyond challenge -- 
		thereby, making the destabilizing arms races of other eras 
		pointless, and limiting rivalries to trade and other pursuits of peace.Today the great powers are also increasingly united by common values, 
		instead of divided by conflicting ideologies. The United States, Japan 
		and our Pacific friends, and now all of Europe, share a deep commitment 
		to human freedom, embodied in strong alliances such as NATO. And the 
		tide of liberty is rising in many other nations.Generations of West Point officers planned and practiced for battles 
		with Soviet Russia. I've just returned from a new Russia, now a country 
		reaching toward democracy, and our partner in the war against terror.  
		Even in China, leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only 
		lasting source of national wealth. In time, they will find that social 
		and political freedom is the only true source of national greatness.When the great powers share common values, we are better able to 
		confront serious regional conflicts together, better able to cooperate 
		in preventing the spread of violence or economic chaos. In the past, 
		great power rivals took sides in difficult regional problems, making 
		divisions deeper and more complicated. Today, from the Middle East to 
		South Asia, we are gathering broad international coalitions to increase 
		the pressure for peace. We must build strong and great power relations 
		when times are good; to help manage crisis when times are bad. America 
		needs partners to preserve the peace, and we will work with every nation 
		that shares this noble goal.And finally, America stands for more than the absence of war. We have a 
		great opportunity to extend a just peace, by replacing poverty, 
		repression, and resentment around the world with hope of a better day. 
		Through most of history, poverty was persistent, inescapable, and almost 
		universal. In the last few decades, we've seen nations from Chile to 
		South Korea build modern economies and freer societies, lifting millions 
		of people out of despair and want. And there's no mystery to this 
		achievement.The 20th century ended with a single surviving model of human progress, 
		based on non-negotiable demands of human dignity, the rule of law, 
		limits on the power of the state, respect for women and private property 
		and free speech and equal justice and religious tolerance. America 
		cannot impose this vision -- yet we can support and reward governments 
		that make the right choices for their own people. In our development 
		aid, in our diplomatic efforts, in our international broadcasting, and 
		in our educational assistance, the United States will promote moderation 
		and tolerance and human rights. And we will defend the peace that makes 
		all progress possible.When it comes to the common rights and needs of men and women, there is 
		no clash of civilizations. The requirements of freedom apply fully to 
		Africa and Latin America and the entire Islamic world. The peoples of 
		the Islamic nations want and deserve the same freedoms and opportunities 
		as people in every nation. And their governments should listen to their 
		hopes.A truly strong nation will permit legal avenues of dissent for all 
		groups that pursue their aspirations without violence. An advancing 
		nation will pursue economic reform, to unleash the great entrepreneurial 
		energy of its people. A thriving nation will respect the rights of 
		women, because no society can prosper while denying opportunity to half 
		its citizens. Mothers and fathers and children across the Islamic world, 
		and all the world, share the same fears and aspirations. In poverty, 
		they struggle. In tyranny, they suffer. And as we saw in Afghanistan, in 
		liberation they celebrate.America has a greater objective than controlling threats and containing 
		resentment. We will work for a just and peaceful world beyond the war on 
		terror.The bicentennial class of West Point now enters this drama. With all in 
		the United States Army, you will stand between your fellow citizens and 
		grave danger. You will help establish a peace that allows millions 
		around the world to live in liberty and to grow in prosperity. You will 
		face times of calm, and times of crisis. And every test will find you 
		prepared -- because you're the men and women of West Point.  
		You leave here marked by the character of this Academy, carrying with 
		you the highest ideals of our nation.Toward the end of his life, Dwight Eisenhower recalled the first day he 
		stood on the plain at West Point. ""The feeling came over me,"" he said, 
		""that the expression 'the United States of America' would now and 
		henceforth mean something different than it had ever before. From here 
		on, it would be the nation I would be serving, not myself.""Today, your last day at West Point, you begin a life of service in a 
		career unlike any other. You've answered a calling to hardship and 
		purpose, to risk and honor. At the end of every day you will know that 
		you have faithfully done your duty. May you always bring to that duty 
		the high standards of this great American institution. May you always be 
		worthy of the long gray line that stretches two centuries behind you.On behalf of the nation, I congratulate each one of you for the 
		commission you've earned and for the credit you bring to the United 
		States of America.May God bless you all.",emy commencement address military academy commencement addressdelivered june west point nyyour browser support video addressyour browser support audio

for pdfFor too long, the citizens 
		of the Middle East have lived in the midst of death and fear. The hatred 
		of a few holds the hopes of many hostage. The forces of extremism and 
		terror are attempting to kill progress and peace by killing the 
		innocent. And this casts a dark shadow over an entire region. For the 
		sake of all humanity, things must change in the Middle East.It is untenable for Israeli 
		citizens to live in terror. It is untenable for Palestinians to live in 
		squalor and occupation. And the current situation offers no prospect 
		that life will improve. Israeli citizens will continue to be victimized 
		by terrorists, and so Israel will continue to defend herself.In the situation the 
		Palestinian people will grow more and more miserable. My vision is two 
		states, living side by side in peace and security. There is simply no 
		way to achieve that peace until all parties fight terror. Yet, at this 
		critical moment, if all parties will break with the past and set out on 
		a new path, we can overcome the darkness with the light of hope. Peace 
		requires a new and different Palestinian leadership, so that a 
		Palestinian state can be born.I call on the Palestinian 
		people to elect new leaders, leaders not compromised by terror. I call 
		upon them to build a practicing democracy, based on tolerance and 
		liberty. If the Palestinian people actively pursue these goals, America 
		and the world will actively support their efforts. If the Palestinian 
		people meet these goals, they will be able to reach agreement with 
		Israel and Egypt and Jordan on security and other arrangements for 
		independence.And when the Palestinian 
		people have new leaders, new institutions and new security arrangements 
		with their neighbors, the United States of America will support the 
		creation of a Palestinian state whose borders and certain aspects of its 
		sovereignty will be provisional until resolved as part of a final 
		settlement in the Middle East.In the work ahead, we all 
		have responsibilities. The Palestinian people are gifted and capable, 
		and I am confident they can achieve a new birth for their nation. A 
		Palestinian state will never be created by terror -- it will be built 
		through reform. And reform must be more than cosmetic change, or veiled 
		attempt to preserve the status quo. True reform will require entirely 
		new political and economic institutions, based on democracy, market 
		economics and action against terrorism.Today, the elected 
		Palestinian legislature has no authority, and power is concentrated in 
		the hands of an unaccountable few. A Palestinian state can only serve 
		its citizens with a new constitution which separates the powers of 
		government. The Palestinian parliament should have the full authority of 
		a legislative body. Local officials and government ministers need 
		authority of their own and the independence to govern effectively.The United States, along 
		with the European Union and Arab states, will work with Palestinian 
		leaders to create a new constitutional framework, and a working 
		democracy for the Palestinian people. And the United States, along with 
		others in the international community will help the Palestinians 
		organize and monitor fair, multi-party local elections by the end of the 
		year, with national elections to follow.Today, the Palestinian 
		people live in economic stagnation, made worse by official corruption. A 
		Palestinian state will require a vibrant economy, where honest 
		enterprise is encouraged by honest government. The United States, the 
		international donor community and the World Bank stand ready to work 
		with Palestinians on a major project of economic reform and development. 
		The United States, the EU, the World Bank, the International Monetary 
		Fund are willing to oversee reforms in Palestinian finances, encouraging 
		transparency and independent auditing.And the United States, along 
		with our partners in the developed world, will increase our humanitarian 
		assistance to relieve Palestinian suffering. Today, the Palestinian 
		people lack effective courts of law and have no means to defend and 
		vindicate their rights. A Palestinian state will require a system of 
		reliable justice to punish those who prey on the innocent. The United 
		States and members of the international community stand ready to work 
		with Palestinian leaders to establish finance -- establish finance and 
		monitor a truly independent judiciary.Today, Palestinian 
		authorities are encouraging, not opposing, terrorism. This is 
		unacceptable. And the United States will not support the establishment 
		of a Palestinian state until its leaders engage in a sustained fight 
		against the terrorists and dismantle their infrastructure. This will 
		require an externally supervised effort to rebuild and reform the 
		Palestinian security services. The security system must have clear lines 
		of authority and accountability and a unified chain of command.America is pursuing this 
		reform along with key regional states. The world is prepared to help, 
		yet ultimately these steps toward statehood depend on the Palestinian 
		people and their leaders. If they energetically take the path of reform, 
		the rewards can come quickly. If Palestinians embrace democracy, 
		confront corruption and firmly reject terror, they can count on American 
		support for the creation of a provisional state of Palestine.With a dedicated effort, 
		this state could rise rapidly, as it comes to terms with Israel, Egypt 
		and Jordan on practical issues, such as security. The final borders, the 
		capital and other aspects of this state's sovereignty will be negotiated 
		between the parties, as part of a final settlement. Arab states have 
		offered their help in this process, and their help is needed.I've said in the past that 
		nations are either with us or against us in the war on terror. To be 
		counted on the side of peace, nations must act. Every leader actually 
		committed to peace will end incitement to violence in official media, 
		and publicly denounce homicide bombings. Every nation actually committed 
		to peace will stop the flow of money, equipment and recruits to 
		terrorist groups seeking the destruction of Israel -- including Hamas, 
		Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah. Every nation actually committed to peace 
		must block the shipment of Iranian supplies to these groups, and oppose 
		regimes that promote terror, like Iraq. And Syria must choose the right 
		side in the war on terror by closing terrorist camps and expelling 
		terrorist organizations.Leaders who want to be 
		included in the peace process must show by their deeds an undivided 
		support for peace. And as we move toward a peaceful solution, Arab 
		states will be expected to build closer ties of diplomacy and commerce 
		with Israel, leading to full normalization of relations between Israel 
		and the entire Arab world.Israel also has a large 
		stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. Permanent occupation 
		threatens Israel's identity and democracy. A stable, peaceful 
		Palestinian state is necessary to achieve the security that Israel longs 
		for. So I challenge Israel to take concrete steps to support the 
		emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state.As we make progress towards 
		security, Israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held 
		prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent with the recommendations of 
		the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement activity in the occupied 
		territories must stop.The Palestinian economy must 
		be allowed to develop. As violence subsides, freedom of movement should 
		be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians to resume work and normal 
		life. Palestinian legislators and officials, humanitarian and 
		international workers, must be allowed to go about the business of 
		building a better future. And Israel should release frozen Palestinian 
		revenues into honest, accountable hands.I've asked Secretary Powell 
		to work intensively with Middle Eastern and international leaders to 
		realize the vision of a Palestinian state, focusing them on a 
		comprehensive plan to support Palestinian reform and 
		institution-building.Ultimately, Israelis and 
		Palestinians must address the core issues that divide them if there is 
		to be a real peace, resolving all claims and ending the conflict between 
		them. This means that the Israeli occupation that began in 1967 will be 
		ended through a settlement negotiated between the parties, based on U.N. 
		Resolutions 242 and 338, with Israeli withdrawal to secure and recognize 
		borders.We must also resolve 
		questions concerning Jerusalem, the plight and future of Palestinian 
		refugees, and a final peace between Israel and Lebanon, and Israel and a 
		Syria that supports peace and fights terror.All who are familiar with 
		the history of the Middle East realize that there may be setbacks in 
		this process. Trained and determined killers, as we have seen, want to 
		stop it. Yet the Egyptian and Jordanian peace treaties with Israel 
		remind us that with determined and responsible leadership progress can 
		come quickly.As new Palestinian 
		institutions and new leaders emerge, demonstrating real performance on 
		security and reform, I expect Israel to respond and work toward a final 
		status agreement. With intensive effort by all, this agreement could be 
		reached within three years from now. And I and my country will actively 
		lead toward that goal.I can understand the deep 
		anger and anguish of the Israeli people. You've lived too long with fear 
		and funerals, having to avoid markets and public transportation, and 
		forced to put armed guards in kindergarten classrooms. The Palestinian 
		Authority has rejected your offer at hand, and trafficked with 
		terrorists. You have a right to a normal life; you have a right to 
		security; and I deeply believe that you need a reformed, responsible 
		Palestinian partner to achieve that security.I can understand the deep 
		anger and despair of the Palestinian people. For decades you've been 
		treated as pawns in the Middle East conflict. Your interests have been 
		held hostage to a comprehensive peace agreement that never seems to 
		come, as your lives get worse year by year. You deserve democracy and 
		the rule of law. You deserve an open society and a thriving economy. You 
		deserve a life of hope for your children. An end to occupation and a 
		peaceful democratic Palestinian state may seem distant, but America and 
		our partners throughout the world stand ready to help, help you make 
		them possible as soon as possible.If liberty can blossom in 
		the rocky soil of the West Bank and Gaza, it will inspire millions of 
		men and women around the globe who are equally weary of poverty and 
		oppression, equally entitled to the benefits of democratic government.I have a hope for the people 
		of Muslim countries. Your commitments to morality, and learning, and 
		tolerance led to great historical achievements. And those values are 
		alive in the Islamic world today. You have a rich culture, and you share 
		the aspirations of men and women in every culture. Prosperity and 
		freedom and dignity are not just American hopes, or Western hopes. They 
		are universal, human hopes. And even in the violence and turmoil of the 
		Middle East, America believes those hopes have the power to transform 
		lives and nations.This moment is both an 
		opportunity and a test for all parties in the Middle East: an 
		opportunity to lay the foundations for future peace; a test to show who 
		is serious about peace and who is not. The choice here is stark and 
		simple. The Bible says, ""I have set before you life and death; 
		therefore, choose life."" The time has arrived for everyone in this 
		conflict to choose peace, and hope, and life.Thank you very much.",sh rise garden speech garden speech solutiondelivered june white house washington addressyour browser support audio pdffor long

for pdfMr. Secretary-General, 
			Mr. President, distinguished delegates and ladies and gentlemen. We 
			meet one year and one day after a terrorist attack brought grief to 
			my country and brought grief to many citizens of our world.Yesterday we remembered 
			the innocent lives taken that terrible morning. Today we turn to the 
			urgent duty of protecting other lives without illusion and without 
			fear.We've accomplished much 
			in the last year in Afghanistan and beyond. We have much yet to do 
			in Afghanistan and beyond. Many nations represented here have joined 
			in the fight against global terror and the people of the United 
			States are grateful.The United Nations was 
			born in the hope that survived a world war, the hope of a world 
			moving toward justice, escaping old patterns of conflict and fear. 
			The founding members resolved that the peace of the world must never 
			again be destroyed by the will and wickedness of any man.We created a United 
			Nations Security Council so that, unlike the League of Nations, our 
			deliberations would be more than talk, our resolutions would be more 
			than wishes. After generations of deceitful dictators and broken 
			treaties and squandered lives, we've dedicated ourselves to 
			standards of human dignity shared by all and to a system of security 
			defended by all.Today, these standards 
			and this security are challenged.Our commitment to human 
			dignity is challenged by persistent poverty and raging disease. The 
			suffering is great. And our responsibilities are clear. The United 
			States is joining with the world to supply aid where it reaches 
			people and lifts up lives, to extend trade and the prosperity it 
			brings, and to bring medical care where it is desperately needed. As 
			a symbol of our commitment to human dignity. The United States will 
			return to UNESCO.This organization has 
			been reformed, and America will participate fully in its mission to 
			advance human rights and tolerance and learning. Our common security 
			is challenged by regional conflicts, ethnic and religious strife 
			that is ancient, but not inevitable.In the Middle East there 
			can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides.America stands committed 
			to an independent and democratic Palestine, living side-by-side with 
			Israel in peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians 
			deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to 
			their voices. My nation will continue to encourage all parties to 
			step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and 
			comprehensive settlement to the conflict.Above all, our 
			principles and our security are challenged today by outlaw groups 
			and regimes that accept no law of morality and have no limit to 
			their violent ambitions. In the attacks on America a year ago, we 
			saw the destructive intentions of our enemies. This threat hides 
			within many nations, including my own.In cells, in camps, 
			terrorists are plotting further destruction and building new bases 
			for their war against civilization. And our greatest fear is that 
			terrorists will find a shortcut to their mad ambitions when an 
			outlaw regime supplies them with the technologies to kill on a 
			massive scale. In one place and one regime, we find all these 
			dangers in their most lethal and aggressive forms, exactly the kind 
			of aggressive threat the United Nations was born to confront.Twelve years ago, Iraq 
			invaded Kuwait without provocation. And the regime's forces were 
			poised to continue their march to seize other countries and their 
			resources. Had Saddam Hussein been appeased instead of stopped, he 
			would have endangered the peace and stability of the world. Yet this 
			aggression was stopped by the might of coalition forces and the will 
			of the United Nations.To suspend hostilities, 
			to spare himself, Iraq's dictator accepted a series of commitments. 
			The terms were clear to him and to all, and he agreed to prove he is 
			complying with every one of those obligations. He has proven instead 
			only his contempt for the United Nations and for all his pledges. By 
			breaking every pledge, by his deceptions and by his cruelties, 
			Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.In 1991, Security 
			Council Resolution 688 demanded that the Iraqi regime cease at once 
			the repression of its own people, including the systematic 
			repression of minorities, which the council said threatened 
			international peace and security in the region. This demand goes 
			ignored.Last year, the U.N. 
			Commission on Human Rights found that Iraq continues to commit 
			extremely grave violations of human rights and that the regime's 
			repression is all-pervasive.Tens of thousands of 
			political opponents and ordinary citizens have been subjected to 
			arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, summary execution and torture by 
			beating and burning, electric shock, starvation, mutilation and 
			rape.Wives are tortured in 
			front of their husbands; children in the presence of their parents; 
			and all of these horrors concealed from the world by the apparatus 
			of a totalitarian state.In 1991, the U.N. 
			Security Council, through Resolutions 686 and 687, demanded that 
			Iraq return all prisoners from Kuwait and other lands. Iraq's regime 
			agreed. It broke this promise.Last year, the Secretary 
			General's high-level coordinator for this issue reported that 
			Kuwaiti, Saudi, Indian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iranian, Egyptian, 
			Bahraini and Armeni nationals remain unaccounted for; more than 600 
			people. One American pilot is among them.In 1991, the U.N. 
			Security Council through Resolution 687 demanded that Iraq renounce 
			all involvement with terrorism and permit no terrorist organizations 
			to operate in Iraq.Iraq's regime agreed 
			that broke this promise.In violation of Security 
			Council Resolution 1373, Iraq continues to shelter and support 
			terrorist organizations that direct violence against Iran, Israel 
			and Western governments. Iraqi dissidents abroad are targeted for 
			murder.In 1993, Iraq attempted 
			to assassinate the Amir of Kuwait and a former American president. 
			Iraq's government openly praised the attacks of September 11. And Al 
			Qaeda terrorists escaped from Afghanistan and are known to be in 
			Iraq.In 1991, the Iraqi 
			regime agreed destroy and stop developing all weapons of mass 
			destruction and long range missiles and to prove to the world it has 
			done so by complying with rigorous inspections.Iraq has broken every 
			aspect of this fundamental pledge.From 1991 to 1995, the 
			Iraqi regime said it had no biological weapons. After a senior 
			official in its weapons program defected and exposed this lie, the 
			regime admitted to producing tens of thousands of liters of anthrax 
			and other deadly biological agents for use with scud warheads, 
			aerial bombs and aircraft spray tanks.U.N. inspectors believe 
			Iraq has produced two to four times the amount of biological agents 
			it declared and has failed to account for more than three metric 
			tons of material that could be used to produce biological weapons. 
			Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used 
			for the production of biological weapons.United Nations' 
			inspections also reviewed that Iraq like maintains stockpiles of VX, 
			mustard and other chemical agents, and that the regime is rebuilding 
			and expanding facilities capable of producing chemical weapons.And in 1995, after four 
			years of deception, Iraq finally admitted it had a crash nuclear 
			weapons program prior to the Gulf War.We know now, were it not 
			for that war, the regime in Iraq would likely have possessed a 
			nuclear weapon no later than 1993.Today, Iraq continues to 
			withhold important information about its nuclear program, weapons 
			design, procurement logs, experiment data, and accounting of nuclear 
			materials and documentation of foreign assistance. Iraq employs 
			capable nuclear scientists and technicians. It retains physical 
			infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon.Iraq has made several 
			attempts to buy high-strength aluminum tubes used to enrich uranium 
			for a nuclear weapon. Should Iraq acquire fissile material, it would 
			be able to build a nuclear weapon within a year.And Iraq's 
			state-controlled media has reported numerous meetings between Saddam 
			Hussein and his nuclear scientists, leaving little doubt about his 
			continued appetite for these weapons.Iraq also possesses a 
			force of SCUD type missiles with ranges beyond the 150 kilometers 
			permitted by the U.N. Work at testing and production facilities 
			shows that Iraq is building more long range missiles that can 
			inflict mass death throughout the region.In 1990, after Iraq's 
			invasion of Kuwait, the world imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. 
			Those sanctions were maintained after the war to compel the regime's 
			compliance with Security Council Resolutions.In time, Iraq was 
			allowed to use oil revenues to buy food. Saddam Hussein has 
			subverted this program, working around the sanctions to buy missile 
			technology and military materials. He blames the suffering of Iraq's 
			people on the United Nations, even as he uses his oil wealth to 
			build lavish palaces for himself and to buy arms for his country.By refusing to comply 
			with his own agreements, he bears full guilt for the hunger and 
			misery of innocent Iraqi citizens. In 1991, Iraq promised U.N. 
			inspectors immediate and unrestricted access to verify Iraq's 
			commitment to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction and long 
			range missiles. Iraq broke this promise, spending seven years 
			deceiving, evading and harassing U.N. inspectors before ceasing 
			cooperation entirely.Just months after the 
			1991 cease-fire, the Security Council twice renewed its demand that 
			the Iraqi regime cooperate fully with inspectors, condemning Iraq's 
			serious violations of its obligations.The Security Council 
			again renewed that demand in 1994, and twice more in 1996, deploring 
			Iraq's clear violations of its obligations. The Security Council 
			renewed its demand three more times in 1997, citing flagrant 
			violations, and three more times in 1998, calling Iraq's behavior 
			totally unacceptable. And in 1999, the demand was renewed yet again.As we meet today, it's 
			been almost four years since the last U.N. inspector set foot in 
			Iraq -- four years for the Iraqi regime to plan and to build and to 
			test behind the cloak of secrecy. We know that Saddam Hussein 
			pursued weapons of mass murder even when inspectors were in his 
			country. Are we to assume that he stopped when they left?The history, the logic 
			and the facts lead to one conclusion: Saddam Hussein regime is a 
			grave and gathering danger.To suggest otherwise is 
			to hope against the evidence. To assume this regime's good faith is 
			to bet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a 
			reckless gamble, and this is a risk we must not take.Delegates to the General 
			Assembly, we have been more than patient. We've tried sanctions. 
			We've tried the carrot of oil for food and the stick of coalition 
			military strikes. But Saddam Hussein has defied all these efforts 
			and continues to develop weapons of mass destruction.The first time we may be 
			completely certain he has nuclear weapons is when, God forbid, he 
			uses one. We owe it to all our citizens to do everything in our 
			power to prevent that day from coming.The conduct of the Iraqi 
			regime is a threat to the authority of the United Nations and a 
			threat to peace. Iraq has answered a decade of U.N. demands with a 
			decade of defiance. All the world now faces a test, and the United 
			Nations a difficult and defining moment.Are Security Council 
			resolutions to be honored and enforced or cast aside without 
			consequence?Will the United Nations 
			serve the purpose of its founding or will it be irrelevant?The United States help 
			found the United Nations. We want the United Nations to be effective 
			and respectful and successful. We want the resolutions of the 
			world's most important multilateral body to be enforced. And right 
			now those resolutions are being unilaterally subverted by the Iraqi 
			regime.Our partnership of 
			nations can meet the test before us by making clear what we now 
			expect of the Iraqi regime.If the Iraqi regime 
			wishes peace, it will immediately and unconditionally forswear, 
			disclose and remove or destroy all weapons of mass destruction, 
			long-range missiles and all related material.If the Iraqi regime 
			wishes peace, it will immediately end all support for terrorism and 
			act to suppress it -- as all states are required to do by U.N. 
			Security Council resolutions.If the Iraqi regime 
			wishes peace, it will cease persecution of its civilian population, 
			including Shi'a, Sunnis, Kurds, Turkemens and others -- again, as 
			required by Security Council resolutions.If the Iraqi regime 
			wishes peace, it will release or account for all Gulf War personnel 
			whose fate is still unknown.It will return the 
			remains of any who are deceased, return stolen property, accept 
			liability for losses resulting from the invasion of Kuwait and fully 
			cooperate with international efforts to resolve these issues as 
			required by Security Council resolutions.If the Iraqi regime 
			wishes peace, it will immediately end all illicit trade outside the 
			oil-for-food program. It will accept U.N. administration of funds 
			from that program to ensure that the money is used fairly and 
			promptly for the benefit of the Iraqi people.If all these steps are 
			taken, it will signal a new openness and accountability in Iraq and 
			it could open the prospect of the United Nations helping to build a 
			government that represents all Iraqis, a government based on respect 
			for human rights, economic liberty and internationally supervised 
			elections.The United States has no 
			quarrel with the Iraqi people. They've suffered too long in silent 
			captivity. Liberty for the Iraqi people is a great moral cause and a 
			great strategic goal.The people of Iraq 
			deserve it. The security of all nations requires it. Free societies 
			do not intimidate through cruelty and conquest. And open societies 
			do not threaten the world with mass murder. The United States 
			supports political and economic liberty in a unified Iraq.We can harbor no 
			illusions, and that's important today to remember. Saddam Hussein 
			attacked Iran in 1980 and Kuwait in 1990. He's fired ballistic 
			missiles at Iran and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Israel. His regime 
			once ordered the killing of every person between the ages of 15 and 
			70 in certain Kurdish villages in northern Iraq. He has gassed many 
			Iranians and 40 Iraqi villages.My nation will work with 
			the U.N. Security Council to meet our common challenge. If Iraq's 
			regime defies us again, the world must move deliberately, decisively 
			to hold Iraq to account. We will work with the U.N. Security Council 
			for the necessary resolutions.But the purposes of the 
			United States should not be doubted. The Security Council 
			resolutions will be enforced, the just demands of peace and security 
			will be met or action will be unavoidable and a regime that has lost 
			its legitimacy will also lose its power.Events can turn in one 
			of two ways. If we fail to act in the face of danger, the people of 
			Iraq will continue to live in brutal submission. The regime will 
			have new power to bully and dominate and conquer its neighbors, 
			condemning the Middle East to more years of bloodshed and fear. The 
			regime will remain unstable -- the region will remain unstable, with 
			little hope of freedom and isolated from the progress of our times.With every step the 
			Iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terrible 
			weapons, our own options to confront that regime will narrow. And if 
			an emboldened regime were to supply these weapons to terrorists 
			allies, then the attacks of September 11 would be a prelude to far 
			greater horrors.If we meet our 
			responsibilities, if we overcome this danger, we can arrive at a 
			very different future. The people of Iraq can shake off their 
			captivity. They can one day join a democratic Afghanistan and a 
			democratic Palestine inspiring reforms throughout the Muslim world. 
			These nations can show by their example that honest government and 
			respect for women and the great Islamic tradition of learning can 
			triumph in the Middle East and beyond. And we will show that the 
			promise of the United Nations can be fulfilled in our time.Neither of these 
			outcomes is certain. Both have been set before us. We must choose 
			between a world of fear and a world of progress. We cannot stand by 
			and do nothing while dangers gather. We must stand up for our 
			security and for the permanent rights and the hopes of mankind.By heritage and by 
			choice, the United States of America will make that stand. And, 
			delegates to the United Nations, you have the power to make that 
			stand, as well.Thank you very much.",unite nation general assembly unite nation general assemblydelivered september new york nyaudio require flash audioyour browser support audio pdfmr president

		welcome. I'm honored to be here tonight; I appreciate you all coming.Tonight I want to take a few minutes to discuss a grave threat to peace, 
		and America's determination to lead the world in confronting that 
		threat.The threat comes from Iraq. It arises directly from the Iraqi regime's 
		own actions -- its history of aggression, and its drive toward an 
		arsenal of terror. Eleven years ago, as a condition for ending the 
		Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi regime was required to destroy its weapons 
		of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons, and to 
		stop all support for terrorist groups. The Iraqi regime has violated all 
		of those obligations. It possesses and produces chemical and biological 
		weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. It has given shelter and support 
		to terrorism, and practices terror against its own people. The entire 
		world has witnessed Iraq's eleven-year history of defiance, deception 
		and bad faith.We also must never forget the most vivid events of recent history. OnSeptember the 11th, 2001, America felt its vulnerability -- even to 
		threats that gather on the other side of the earth. We resolved then, 
		and we are resolved today, to confront every threat, from any source, 
		that could bring sudden terror and suffering to America.Members of the Congress of both political parties, and members of the 
		United Nations Security Council, agree that Saddam Hussein is a threat 
		to peace and must disarm. We agree that the Iraqi dictator must not be 
		permitted to threaten America and the world with horrible poisons and 
		diseases and gases and atomic weapons. Since we all agree on this goal, 
		the issues is : how can we best achieve it?Many Americans have raised legitimate questions: about the nature of the 
		threat; about the urgency of action -- why be concerned now; about the 
		link between Iraq developing weapons of terror, and the wider war on 
		terror. These are all issues we've discussed broadly and fully within my 
		administration. And tonight, I want to share those discussions with you.First, 
		some ask why Iraq is different from other countries or regimes that also 
		have terrible weapons. While there are many dangers in the world, the 
		threat from Iraq stands alone -- because it gathers the most serious 
		dangers of our age in one place. Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are 
		controlled by a murderous tyrant who has already used chemical weapons 
		to kill thousands of people. This same tyrant has tried to dominate the 
		Middle East, has invaded and brutally occupied a small neighbor, has 
		struck other nations without warning, and holds an unrelenting hostility 
		toward the United States.By its past and present actions, by its technological capabilities, by 
		the merciless nature of its regime, Iraq is unique. As a former chief 
		weapons inspector of the U.N. has said, ""The fundamental problem with 
		Iraq remains the nature of the regime, itself. Saddam Hussein is a 
		homicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction.""Some ask how urgent this danger is to America and the world. The danger 
		is already significant, and it only grows worse with time. If we know 
		Saddam Hussein has dangerous weapons today -- and we do -- does it make 
		any sense for the world to wait to confront him as he grows even 
		stronger and develops even more dangerous weapons?In 1995, after several years of deceit by the Iraqi regime, the head of 
		Iraq's military industries defected. It was then that the regime was 
		forced to admit that it had produced more than 30,000 liters of anthrax 
		and other deadly biological agents. The inspectors, however, concluded 
		that Iraq had likely produced two to four times that amount. This is a 
		massive stockpile of biological weapons that has never been accounted 
		for, and capable of killing millions.We know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical 
		agents, including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, VX nerve gas. Saddam 
		Hussein also has experience in using chemical weapons. He has ordered 
		chemical attacks on Iran, and on more than forty villages in his own 
		country. These actions killed or injured at least 20,000 people, more 
		than six times the number of people who died in the attacks of September 
		the 11th.And surveillance photos reveal that the regime is rebuilding facilities 
		that it had used to produce chemical and biological weapons. Every 
		chemical and biological weapon that Iraq has or makes is a direct 
		violation of the truce that ended the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Yet, 
		Saddam Hussein has chosen to build and keep these weapons despite 
		international sanctions, U.N. demands, and isolation from the civilized 
		world.Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of hundreds of 
		miles -- far enough to strike Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, and other 
		nations -- in a region where more than 135,000 American civilians and 
		service members live and work. We've also discovered through 
		intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial 
		vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical or biological weapons 
		across broad areas. We're concerned that Iraq is exploring ways of using 
		these UAVS for missions targeting the United States. And, of course, 
		sophisticated delivery systems aren't required for a chemical or 
		biological attack; all that might be required are a small container and 
		one terrorist or Iraqi intelligence operative to deliver it.And that is the source of our urgent concern about Saddam Hussein's 
		links to international terrorist groups. Over the years, Iraq has 
		provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal, whose terror 
		organization carried out more than 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries 
		that killed or injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans. Iraq 
		has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, who was responsible for 
		seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger. And we know 
		that Iraq is continuing to finance terror and gives assistance to groups 
		that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace.We know that Iraq and the al Qaeda terrorist network share a common 
		enemy -- the United States of America. We know that Iraq and al Qaeda 
		have had high-level contacts that go back a decade. Some al Qaeda 
		leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq. These include one very senior 
		al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year, and 
		who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological 
		attacks. We've learned that Iraq has trained al Qaeda members in 
		bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after 
		September the 11th, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the 
		terrorist attacks on America.Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical 
		weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists. Alliance with 
		terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without 
		leaving any fingerprints.Some have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract 
		from the war against terror. To the contrary; confronting the threat 
		posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war on terror. When I spoke to 
		Congress more than a year ago, I said that those who harbor terrorists 
		are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. Saddam Hussein is harboring 
		terrorists and the instruments of terror, the instruments of mass death 
		and destruction. And he cannot be trusted. The risk is simply too great 
		that he will use them, or provide them to a terror network.Terror cells and outlaw regimes building weapons of mass destruction are 
		different faces of the same evil. Our security requires that we confront 
		both. And the United States military is capable of confronting both.Many people have asked how close Saddam Hussein is to developing a 
		nuclear weapon. Well, we don't know exactly, and that's the problem. 
		Before the Gulf War, the best intelligence indicated that Iraq was eight 
		to ten years away from developing a nuclear weapon. After the war, 
		international inspectors learned that the regime has been much closer -- 
		the regime in Iraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later 
		than 1993. The inspectors discovered that Iraq had an advanced nuclear 
		weapons development program, had a design for a workable nuclear weapon, 
		and was pursuing several different methods of enriching uranium for a 
		bomb.Before being barred from Iraq in 1998, the International Atomic Energy 
		Agency dismantled extensive nuclear weapons-related facilities, 
		including three uranium enrichment sites. That same year, information 
		from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed 
		that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear 
		program to continue.The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons 
		program. Saddam Hussein has held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear 
		scientists, a group he calls his ""nuclear mujahideen"" -- his nuclear 
		holy warriors. Satellite photographs reveal that Iraq is rebuilding 
		facilities at sites that have been part of its nuclear program in the 
		past. Iraq has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes and 
		other equipment needed for gas centrifuges, which are used to enrich 
		uranium for nuclear weapons.If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of 
		highly enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball, it could 
		have a nuclear weapon in less than a year. And if we allow that to 
		happen, a terrible line would be crossed. Saddam Hussein would be in a 
		position to blackmail anyone who opposes his aggression. He would be in 
		a position to dominate the Middle East. He would be in a position to 
		threaten America. And Saddam Hussein would be in a position to pass 
		nuclear technology to terrorists.Some citizens wonder, after 11 years of living with this problem, why do 
		we need to confront it now? And there's a reason. We've experienced the 
		horror of September the 11th. We have seen that those who hate America 
		are willing to crash airplanes into buildings full of innocent people. 
		Our enemies would be no less willing, in fact, they would be eager, to 
		use biological or chemical, or a nuclear weapon.Knowing these realities, America must not ignore the threat gathering 
		against us. Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final 
		proof -- the smoking gun -- that could come in the form of a mushroom 
		cloud. As President Kennedy said in October of 1962, ""Neither the United 
		States of America, nor the world community of nations can tolerate 
		deliberate deception and offensive threats on the part of any nation, 
		large or small. We no longer live in a world,"" he said, ""where only the 
		actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge to a nations 
		security to constitute maximum peril.""Understanding the threats of our time, knowing the designs and 
		deceptions of the Iraqi regime, we have every reason to assume the 
		worst, and we have an urgent duty to prevent the worst from occurring.Some believe we can address this danger by simply resuming the old 
		approach to inspections, and applying diplomatic and economic pressure. 
		Yet this is precisely what the world has tried to do since 1991. The 
		U.N. inspections program was met with systematic deception. The Iraqi 
		regime bugged hotel rooms and offices of inspectors to find where they 
		were going next; they forged documents, destroyed evidence, and 
		developed mobile weapons facilities to keep a step ahead of inspectors. 
		Eight so-called presidential palaces were declared off-limits to 
		unfettered inspections. These sites actually encompass twelve square 
		miles, with hundreds of structures, both above and below the ground, 
		where sensitive materials could be hidden.The world has also tried economic sanctions -- and watched Iraq use 
		billions of dollars in illegal oil revenues to fund more weapons 
		purchases, rather than providing for the needs of the Iraqi people.The world has tried limited military strikes to destroy Iraq's weapons 
		of mass destruction capabilities -- only to see them openly rebuilt, 
		while the regime again denies they even exist.The world has tried no-fly zones to keep Saddam from terrorizing his own 
		people -- and in the last year alone, the Iraqi military has fired upon 
		American and British pilots more than 750 times.After eleven years during which we have tried containment, sanctions, 
		inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that 
		Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons and is 
		increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer 
		to developing a nuclear weapon.Clearly, to actually work, any new inspections, sanctions or enforcement 
		mechanisms will have to be very different. America wants the U.N. to be 
		an effective organization that helps keep the peace. And that is why we 
		are urging the Security Council to adopt a new resolution setting out 
		tough, immediate requirements. Among those requirements: the Iraqi 
		regime must reveal and destroy, under U.N. supervision, all existing 
		weapons of mass destruction. To ensure that we learn the truth, the 
		regime must allow witnesses to its illegal activities to be interviewed 
		outside the country -- and these witnesses must be free to bring their 
		families with them so they all beyond the reach of Saddam Hussein's 
		terror and murder. And inspectors must have access to any site, at any 
		time, without pre-clearance, without delay, without exceptions.The time for denying, deceiving, and delaying has come to an end. Saddam 
		Hussein must disarm himself -- or, for the sake of peace, we will lead a 
		coalition to disarm him.Many nations are joining us in insisting that Saddam Hussein's regime be 
		held accountable. They are committed to defending the international 
		security that protects the lives of both our citizens and theirs. And 
		that's why America is challenging all nations to take the resolutions of 
		the U.N. Security Council seriously.And these resolutions are clear. In addition to declaring and destroying 
		all of its weapons of mass destruction, Iraq must end its support for 
		terrorism. It must cease the persecution of its civilian population. It 
		must stop all illicit trade outside the Oil For Food program. It must 
		release or account for all Gulf War personnel, including an American 
		pilot, whose fate is still unknown.By taking these steps, and by only taking these steps, the Iraqi regime 
		has an opportunity to avoid conflict. Taking these steps would also 
		change the nature of the Iraqi regime itself. America hopes the regime 
		will make that choice. Unfortunately, at least so far, we have little 
		reason to expect it. And that's why two administrations -- mine and 
		President Clinton's -- have stated that regime change in Iraq is the 
		only certain means of removing a great danger to our nation.I hope this will not require military action, but it may. And military 
		conflict could be difficult. An Iraqi regime faced with its own demise 
		may attempt cruel and desperate measures. If Saddam Hussein orders such 
		measures, his generals would be well advised to refuse those orders. If 
		they do not refuse, they must understand that all war criminals will be 
		pursued and punished. If we have to act, we will take every precaution 
		that is possible. We will plan carefully; we will act with the full 
		power of the United States military; we will act with allies at our 
		side, and we will prevail.There is no easy or risk-free course of action. Some have argued we 
		should wait -- and that's an option. In my view, it's the riskiest of 
		all options, because the longer we wait, the stronger and bolder Saddam 
		Hussein will become. We could wait and hope that Saddam does not give 
		weapons to terrorists, or develop a nuclear weapon to blackmail the 
		world. But I'm convinced that is a hope against all evidence. As 
		Americans, we want peace -- we work and sacrifice for peace. But there 
		can be no peace if our security depends on the will and whims of a 
		ruthless and aggressive dictator. I'm not willing to stake one American 
		life on trusting Saddam Hussein.Failure to act would embolden other tyrants, allow terrorists access to 
		new weapons and new resources, and make blackmail a permanent feature of 
		world events. The United Nations would betray the purpose of its 
		founding, and prove irrelevant to the problems of our time. And through 
		its inaction, the United States would resign itself to a future of fear.That is not the America I know. That is not the America I serve. We 
		refuse to live in fear. This nation, in world war and in 
		Cold War, has never permitted the brutal and lawless to set history's 
		course. Now, as before, we will secure our nation, protect our freedom, 
		and help others to find freedom of their own.Some worry that a change of leadership in Iraq could create instability 
		and make the situation worse. The situation could hardly get worse, for 
		world security and for the people of Iraq. The lives of Iraqi citizens 
		would improve dramatically if Saddam Hussein were no longer in power, 
		just as the lives of Afghanistan's citizens improved after the Taliban. 
		The dictator of Iraq is a student of Stalin, using murder as a tool of 
		terror and control, within his own cabinet, within his own army, and 
		even within his own family.On Saddam Hussein's orders, opponents have been decapitated, wives and 
		mothers of political opponents have been systematically raped as a 
		method of intimidation, and political prisoners have been forced to 
		watch their own children being tortured.America believes that all people are entitled to hope and human rights, 
		to the non-negotiable demands of human dignity. People everywhere prefer 
		freedom to slavery; prosperity to squalor; self-government to the rule 
		of terror and torture. America is a friend to the people of Iraq. Our 
		demands are directed only at the regime that enslaves them and threatens 
		us. When these demands are met, the first and greatest benefit will come 
		to Iraqi men, women and children. The oppression of Kurds, Assyrians, 
		Turkomans, Shi'a, Sunnis and others will be lifted. The long captivity 
		of Iraq will end, and an era of new hope will begin.Iraq is a land rich in culture, resources, and talent. Freed from the 
		weight of oppression, Iraq's people will be able to share in the 
		progress and prosperity of our time. If military action is necessary, 
		the United States and our allies will help the Iraqi people rebuild 
		their economy, and create the institutions of liberty in a unified Iraq 
		at peace with its neighbors.Later this week, the United States Congress will vote on this matter. I 
		have asked Congress to authorize the use of America's military, if it 
		proves necessary, to enforce U.N. Security Council demands. Approving 
		this resolution does not mean that military action is imminent or 
		unavoidable. The resolution will tell the United Nations, and all 
		nations, that America speaks with one voice and is determined to make 
		the demands of the civilized world mean something. Congress will also be 
		sending a message to the dictator in Iraq: that his only chance -- his 
		only choice is full compliance, and the time remaining for that choice 
		is limited.Members of Congress are nearing an historic vote. I'm confident they 
		will fully consider the facts, and their duties.The attacks of September the 11th showed our country that vast oceans no 
		longer protect us from danger. Before that tragic date, we had only 
		hints of al Qaeda's plans and designs. Today in Iraq, we see a threat 
		whose outlines are far more clearly defined, and whose consequences 
		could be far more deadly. Saddam Hussein's actions have put us on 
		notice, and there is no refuge from our responsibilities.We did not ask for this present challenge, but we accept it. Like other 
		generations of Americans, we will meet the responsibility of defending 
		human liberty against violence and aggression. By our resolve, we will 
		give strength to others. By our courage, we will give hope to others. 
		And by our actions, we will secure the peace, and lead the world to a 
		better day.May God bless America.",innati case war nation threat iraqdelivered october cincinnati union terminal cincinnati ohioaudio require flash audioyour browser support audio pdfthank gracious

audio.]Their mission was almost 
		complete, and we lost them so close to home. The men and women of the 
		Columbia had journeyed more than 6 million miles and were minutes away 
		from arrival and reunion.The loss was sudden and 
		terrible, and for their families, the grief is heavy. Our nation shares 
		in your sorrow and in your pride. And today we remember not only one 
		moment of tragedy, but seven lives of great purpose and achievement.To leave behind Earth 
		and air and gravity is an ancient dream of humanity. For these seven, it 
		was a dream fulfilled. Each of these astronauts had the daring and 
		discipline required of their calling. Each of them knew that great 
		endeavors are inseparable from great risks. And each of them accepted 
		those risks willingly, even joyfully, in the cause of discovery.Rick Husbandwas a boy of 
		four when he first thought of being an astronaut. As a man, and having 
		become an astronaut, he found it was even more important to love his 
		family and serve his Lord. One of Rick's favorite hymns was, ""How Great 
		Thou Art,"" which offers these words of praise: ""I see the stars. I hear 
		the mighty thunder. Thy power throughout the universe displayed.""David Brownwas first drawn 
		to the stars as a little boy with a telescope in his back yard. He 
		admired astronauts, but, as he said, ""I thought they were movie stars. I 
		thought I was kind of a normal kid."" David grew up to be a physician, an 
		aviator who could land on the deck of a carrier in the middle of the 
		night, and a shuttle astronaut. His brother asked him 
		several weeks ago what would happen if something went wrong on their 
		mission. David replied, ""This program will go on.""Michael Andersonalways 
		wanted to fly planes, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Air 
		Force. Along the way, he became a role model -- especially for his two 
		daughters and for the many children he spoke to in schools. He said to 
		them, ""Whatever you want to be in life, you're training for it now."" He 
		also told his minister, ""If this thing doesn't come out right, don't 
		worry about me. I'm just going on higher.""Laurel Salton Clarkwas a 
		physician and a flight surgeon who loved adventure, loved her work, 
		loved her husband, and her son. A friend who heard Laurel speaking to 
		Mission Control said, ""There was a smile in her voice."" Laurel conducted some of the 
		experiments as Columbia orbited the Earth, and described seeing new life 
		emerge from a tiny cocoon. ""Life,"" she said, ""continues in a lot of 
		places, and life is a magical thing.""None of our astronauts 
		traveled a longer path to space thanKalpana Chawla. She left India as a 
		student, but she would see the nation of her birth -- all of it -- from 
		hundreds of miles above. When the sad news reached her home town, an 
		administrator at her high school recalled, ""She always said she wanted 
		to reach the stars. She went there -- and beyond."" Kalpana's native 
		country mourns her today, and so does her adopted land.Ilan Ramonalso flew above 
		his home, the land of Israel. He said, ""The quiet that envelopes space 
		makes the beauty even more powerful. And I only hope that the quiet can 
		one day spread to my country."" Ilan was a patriot -- the devoted son of a 
		holocaust survivor, served his country in two wars. ""Ilan,"" said his 
		wife, Rona, ""left us at his peak moment, in his favorite place, with 
		people he loved.""The Columbia's pilot wasCommander Willie McCool, whom friends knew as the most steady and 
		dependable of men. In Lubbock today, they're thinking back to the Eagle 
		Scout who became a distinguished Naval officer, and a fearless test 
		pilot. One friend remembers Willie this way: ""He was blessed; and we 
		were blessed to know him.""Our whole nation was blessed 
		to have such men and women serving in our space program. Their loss is 
		deeply felt, especially in this place, where so many of you called them 
		friends. The people in NASA are being tested once again. In your grief, 
		you are responding as your friends would have wished -- with focus, 
		professionalism, and unbroken faith in the mission of this agency.Captain Brown was correct: 
		America's space program will go on.This cause of exploration 
		and discovery is not an option we choose; it is a desire written in the 
		human heart. We are that part of creation which seeks to understand all 
		creation. We find the best among us, send them forth into unmapped 
		darkness, and pray they will return. They go in peace for all mankind, 
		and all mankind is in their debt.Yet, some explorers do not 
		return. And the loss settles unfairly on a few. The families here today 
		shared in the courage of those they loved. But now they must face life 
		and grief without them. The sorrow is lonely; but you are not alone. In 
		time, you will find comfort and the grace to see you through. And in 
		God's own time, we can pray that the day of your reunion will come.And to the children who miss 
		your Mom or Dad so much today, you need to know they love you, and that 
		love will always be with you. They were proud of you. And you can be 
		proud of them for the rest of your life.The final days of their own 
		lives were spent looking down upon this Earth. And now, on every 
		continent, in every land they could see, the names of these astronauts 
		are known and remembered. They will always have an honored place in the 
		memory of this country. And today I offer the respect and gratitude of 
		the people of the United States.May God bless you all.",sh speech memorial service space shuttle columbia memorial service shuttle columbia astronautsdelivered february johnson space center houston

for pdfThanks for the warm 
		welcome. I'm proud to be with the scholars, and the friends, and the 
		supporters of the American Enterprise Institute. I want to thank you for 
		overlooking my dress code violation.  They were about to stop me at 
		the door, but Irving Kristol said, ""I know this guy, let him in.""Chris, thank you for your 
		very kind introduction, and thank you for your leadership. I see many 
		distinguished guests here tonight -- members of my Cabinet, members of 
		Congress, Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and so many respected writers 
		and policy experts. I'm always happy to see your Senior Fellow, Dr. 
		Lynne Cheney.  Lynne is a wise and thoughtful commentator on 
		history and culture, and a dear friend to Laura and me. I'm also 
		familiar with the good work of her husband --  You may remember 
		him, the former director of my vice presidential search committee.  
		Thank God Dick Cheney said yes.Thanks for fitting me into the program tonight. I know I'm not the 
		featured speaker. I'm just a warm-up act for Allan Meltzer. But I want 
		to congratulate Dr. Meltzer for a lifetime of achievement, and for 
		tonight's well-deserved honor. Congratulations.At the American Enterprise 
		Institute, some of the finest minds in our nation are at work on some of 
		the greatest challenges to our nation. You do such good work that my 
		administration has borrowed 20 such minds. I want to thank them for 
		their service, but I also want to remind people that for 60 years, AEI 
		scholars have made vital contributions to our country and to our 
		government, and we are grateful for those contributions.We meet here during a 
		crucial period in the history of our nation, and of the civilized world. 
		Part of that history was written by others; the rest will be written by 
		us.  On a September morning, threats that had gathered for 
		years, in secret and far away, led to murder in our country on a massive 
		scale. As a result, we must look at security in a new way, because our 
		country is a battlefield in the first war of the 21st century.We learned a lesson: The dangers of our time must be confronted actively 
		and forcefully, before we see them again in our skies and in our cities. 
		And we set a goal: we will not allow the triumph of hatred and violence 
		in the affairs of men.Our coalition of more than 
		90 countries is pursuing the networks of terror with every tool of law 
		enforcement and with military power. We have arrested, or otherwise 
		dealt with, many key commanders of al Qaeda.  Across the 
		world, we are hunting down the killers one by one. We are winning. And 
		we're showing them the definition of American justice.  And 
		we are opposing the greatest danger in the war on terror: outlaw regimes 
		arming with weapons of mass destruction.In Iraq, a dictator is 
		building and hiding weapons that could enable him to dominate the Middle 
		East and intimidate the civilized world -- and we will not allow it.  
		This same tyrant has close ties to terrorist organizations, and could 
		supply them with the terrible means to strike this country -- and 
		America will not permit it. The danger posed by Saddam Hussein and his 
		weapons cannot be ignored or wished away. The danger must be confronted. 
		We hope that the Iraqi regime will meet the demands of the United 
		Nations and disarm, fully and peacefully. If it does not, we are 
		prepared to disarm Iraq by force. Either way, this danger will be 
		removed.The safety of the American people depends on ending this direct and 
		growing threat. Acting against the danger will also contribute greatly 
		to the long-term safety and stability of our world. The current Iraqi 
		regime has shown the power of tyranny to spread discord and violence in 
		the Middle East. A liberated Iraq can show the power of freedom to 
		transform that vital region, by bringing hope and progress into the 
		lives of millions. America's interests in security, and America's belief 
		in liberty, both lead in the same direction: to a free and peaceful 
		Iraq.The first to benefit from a free Iraq would be the Iraqi people, 
		themselves. Today they live in scarcity and fear, under a dictator who 
		has brought them nothing but war, and misery, and torture. Their lives 
		and their freedom matter little to Saddam Hussein -- but Iraqi lives and 
		freedom matter greatly to us.Bringing stability and unity to a free Iraq will not be easy. Yet that 
		is no excuse to leave the Iraqi regime's torture chambers and poison 
		labs in operation. Any future the Iraqi people choose for themselves 
		will be better than the nightmare world that Saddam Hussein has chosen 
		for them.If we must use force, the 
		United States and our coalition stand ready to help the citizens of a 
		liberated Iraq. We will deliver medicine to the sick, and we are now 
		moving into place nearly 3 million emergency rations to feed the hungry.We'll make sure that 
		Iraq's 55,000 food distribution sites, operating under the Oil For Food 
		program, are stocked and open as soon as possible. The United States and 
		Great Britain are providing tens of millions of dollars to the U.N. High 
		Commission on Refugees, and to such groups as the World Food Program and 
		UNICEF, to provide emergency aid to the Iraqi people.We will also lead in carrying out the urgent and dangerous work of 
		destroying chemical and biological weapons. We will provide security 
		against those who try to spread chaos, or settle scores, or threaten the 
		territorial integrity of Iraq. We will seek to protect Iraq's natural 
		resources from sabotage by a dying regime, and ensure those resources 
		are used for the benefit of the owners -- the Iraqi people.The United States has no intention of determining the precise form of 
		Iraq's new government. That choice belongs to the Iraqi people. Yet, we 
		will ensure that one brutal dictator is not replaced by another. All 
		Iraqis must have a voice in the new government, and all citizens must 
		have their rights protected.Rebuilding Iraq will 
		require a sustained commitment from many nations, including our own: we 
		will remain in Iraq as long as necessary, and not a day more. America 
		has made and kept this kind of commitment before -- in the peace that 
		followed a world war. After defeating enemies, we did not leave behind 
		occupying armies, we left constitutions and parliaments. We established 
		an atmosphere of safety, in which responsible, reform-minded local 
		leaders could build lasting institutions of freedom. In societies that 
		once bred fascism and militarism, liberty found a permanent home.There was a time when many 
		said that the cultures of Japan and Germany were incapable of sustaining 
		democratic values. Well, they were wrong. Some say the same of Iraq 
		today. They are mistaken.  The nation of Iraq -- with its proud 
		heritage, abundant resources and skilled and educated people -- is fully 
		capable of moving toward democracy and living in freedom.The world has a clear interest in the spread of democratic values, 
		because stable and free nations do not breed the ideologies of murder. 
		They encourage the peaceful pursuit of a better life. And there are 
		hopeful signs of a desire for freedom in the Middle East. Arab 
		intellectuals have called on Arab governments to address the ""freedom 
		gap"" so their peoples can fully share in the progress of our times. 
		Leaders in the region speak of a new Arab charter that champions 
		internal reform, greater politics participation, economic openness, and 
		free trade. And from Morocco to Bahrain and beyond, nations are taking 
		genuine steps toward politics reform. A new regime in Iraq would serve 
		as a dramatic and inspiring example of freedom for other nations in the 
		region.It is presumptuous and insulting to suggest that a whole region of the 
		world -- or the one-fifth of humanity that is Muslim -- is somehow 
		untouched by the most basic aspirations of life. Human cultures can be 
		vastly different. Yet the human heart desires the same good things, 
		everywhere on Earth. In our desire to be safe from brutal and bullying 
		oppression, human beings are the same. In our desire to care for our 
		children and give them a better life, we are the same. For these 
		fundamental reasons, freedom and democracy will always and everywhere 
		have greater appeal than the slogans of hatred and the tactics of 
		terror.Success in Iraq could also 
		begin a new stage for Middle Eastern peace, and set in motion progress 
		towards a truly democratic Palestinian state.  The passing of 
		Saddam Hussein's regime will deprive terrorist networks of a wealthy 
		patron that pays for terrorist training, and offers rewards to families 
		of suicide bombers. And other regimes will be given a clear warning that 
		support for terror will not be tolerated.Without this outside 
		support for terrorism, Palestinians who are working for reform and long 
		for democracy will be in a better position to choose new leaders.  
		True leaders who strive for peace; true leaders who faithfully serve the 
		people. A Palestinian state must be a reformed and peaceful state that 
		abandons forever the use of terror.For its part, the new 
		government of Israel -- as the terror threat is removed and security 
		improves -- will be expected to support the creation of a viable 
		Palestinian state and to work as quickly as possible 
		toward a final status agreement. As progress is made toward peace, 
		settlement activity in the occupied territories must end.  And the 
		Arab states will be expected to meet their responsibilities to oppose 
		terrorism, to support the emergence of a peaceful and democratic 
		Palestine, and state clearly they will live in peace with Israel.The United States and other nations are working on a road map for peace. 
		We are setting out the necessary conditions for progress toward the goal 
		of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and 
		security. It is the commitment of our government -- and my personal 
		commitment -- to implement the road map and to reach that goal. Old 
		patterns of conflict in the Middle East can be broken, if all concerned 
		will let go of bitterness, hatred, and violence, and get on with the 
		serious work of economic development, and political reform, and 
		reconciliation. America will seize every opportunity in pursuit of 
		peace. And the end of the present regime in Iraq would create such an 
		opportunity.In confronting Iraq, the United States is also showing our commitment to 
		effective international institutions. We are a permanent member of the 
		United Nations Security Council. We helped to create the Security 
		Council. We believe in the Security Council -- so much that we want its 
		words to have meaning.The global threat of 
		proliferation of weapons of mass destruction cannot be confronted by one 
		nation alone. The world needs today and will need tomorrow international 
		bodies with the authority and the will to stop the spread of terror and 
		chemical and biological and nuclear weapons. A threat to all must be 
		answered by all. High-minded pronouncements against proliferation mean 
		little unless the strongest nations are willing to stand behind them -- 
		and use force if necessary. After all, the United Nations was created, 
		as Winston Churchill said, to ""make sure that the force of right will, 
		in the ultimate issue, be protected by the right of force.""Another resolution is now 
		before the Security Council. If the council responds to Iraq's defiance 
		with more excuses and delays, if all its authority proves to be empty, 
		the United Nations will be severely weakened as a source of stability 
		and order. If the members rise to this moment, then the Council will 
		fulfill its founding purpose.I've listened carefully, as people and leaders around the world have 
		made known their desire for peace. All of us want peace. The threat to 
		peace does not come from those who seek to enforce the just demands of 
		the civilized world; the threat to peace comes from those who flout 
		those demands. If we have to act, we will act to restrain the violent, 
		and defend the cause of peace. And by acting, we will signal to outlaw 
		regimes that in this new century, the boundaries of civilized behavior 
		will be respected.Protecting those 
		boundaries carries a cost. If war is forced upon us by Iraq's refusal to 
		disarm, we will meet an enemy who hides his military forces behind

audio.]My fellow citizens, events in Iraq 
have now reached the final days of decision. For more than a decade, the United 
States and other nations have pursued patient and honorable efforts to disarm 
the Iraqi regime without war. That regime pledged to reveal and destroy all its 
weapons of mass destruction as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War in 
1991.Since then, the world has engaged in 
12 years of diplomacy. We have passed more than a dozen resolutions in the 
United Nations Security Council. We have sent hundreds of weapons inspectors to 
oversee the disarmament of Iraq. Our good faith has not been returned.The Iraqi regime has used diplomacy 
as a ploy to gain time and advantage. It has uniformly defied Security Council 
resolutions demanding full disarmament. Over the years, U.N. weapon inspectors 
have been threatened by Iraqi officials, electronically bugged, and 
systematically deceived. Peaceful efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime have failed 
again and again -- because we are not dealing with peaceful men.Intelligence gathered by this and 
other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and 
conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised. This regime has already 
used weapons of mass destruction against Iraq's neighbors and against Iraq's 
people.The regime has a history of reckless 
aggression in the Middle East. It has a deep hatred of America and our friends. 
And it has aided, trained, and harbored terrorists, including operatives of al 
Qaeda.The danger is clear: using chemical, 
biological, or, one day, nuclear weapons, obtained with the help of Iraq, the 
terrorists could fulfill their stated ambitions and kill thousands or hundreds 
of thousands of innocent people in our country, or any other.The United States and other nations 
did nothing to deserve or invite this threat. But we will do everything to 
defeat it. Instead of drifting along toward tragedy, we will set a course toward 
safety. Before the day of horror can come, before it is too late to act, this 
danger will be removed.The United States of America has the 
sovereign authority to use force in assuring its own national security. That 
duty falls to me, as Commander-in-Chief, by the oath I have sworn, by the oath I 
will keep.Recognizing the threat to our 
country, the United States Congress voted overwhelmingly last year to support 
the use of force against Iraq. America tried to work with the United Nations to 
address this threat because we wanted to resolve the issue peacefully. We 
believe in the mission of the United Nations. One reason the U.N. was founded 
after the second world war was to confront aggressive dictators, actively and 
early, before they can attack the innocent and destroy the peace.In the case of Iraq, the Security Council did act, in the early 1990s. Under 
Resolutions678and687-- both still in effect -- the United States and our 
allies are authorized to use force in ridding Iraq of weapons of mass 
destruction. This is not a question of authority; it is a question of will.Last September,I went to the U.N. 
General Assemblyand urged the nations of the world to unite and bring an end to 
this danger. On November 8th, the Security Council unanimously passedResolution 
1441, finding Iraq in material breach of its obligations, and vowing serious 
consequences if Iraq did not fully and immediately disarm.Today, no nation can possibly claim 
that Iraq has disarmed. And it will not disarm so long as Saddam Hussein holds 
power. For the last four-and-a-half months, the United States and our allies 
have worked within the Security Council to enforce that Council's long-standing 
demands. Yet, some permanent members of the Security Council have publicly 
announced they will veto any resolution that compels the disarmament of Iraq. 
These governments share our assessment of the
danger, but not our resolve to meet it. Many nations, however, do have the 
resolve and fortitude to act against this threat to peace, and a broad coalition 
is now gathering to enforce the just demands of the world. The United Nations 
Security Council has not lived up to its responsibilities, so we will rise to 
ours.In recent days, some governments in 
the Middle East have been doing their part. They have delivered public and 
private messages urging the dictator to leave Iraq, so that disarmament can 
proceed peacefully. He has thus far refused. All the decades of deceit and 
cruelty have now reached an end. Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq 
within 48 hours. Their refusal to do so will result in military conflict, 
commenced at a time of our choosing. For their own safety, all foreign nationals 
-- including journalists and inspectors -- should leave Iraq immediately.Many Iraqis can hear me tonight in a 
translated radio broadcast, and I have a message for them. If we must begin a 
military campaign, it will be directed against the lawless men who rule your 
country and not against you. As our coalition takes away their power, we will 
deliver the food and medicine you need. We will tear down the apparatus of 
terror and we will help you to build a new Iraq that is prosperous and free. In 
a free Iraq, there will be no more wars of aggression against
your neighbors, no more poison factories, no more executions of dissidents, no 
more torture chambers and rape rooms. The tyrant will soon be gone. The day of 
your liberation is near.It is too late for Saddam Hussein to remain in power. It is not too late for the 
Iraqi military to act with honor and protect your country by permitting the 
peaceful entry of coalition forces to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. Our 
forces will give Iraqi military units clear instructions on actions they can 
take to avoid being attacked and destroyed. I urge every member of the Iraqi 
military and intelligence services, if war comes, do not fight for a dying 
regime that is not worth your own life.And all Iraqi military and civilian 
personnel should listen carefully to this warning: In any conflict, your fate 
will depend on your actions. Do not destroy oil wells, a source of wealth that 
belongs to the Iraqi people. Do not obey any command to use weapons of mass 
destruction against anyone, including the Iraqi people. War crimes will be 
prosecuted. War criminals will be punished. And it will be no defense to say, ""I 
was just following orders.""Should Saddam Hussein choose 
confrontation, the American people can know that every measure has been taken to 
avoid war, and every measure will be taken to win it. Americans understand the 
costs of conflict because we have paid them in the past. War has no certainty, 
except the certainty of sacrifice.Yet, the only way to reduce the harm 
and duration of war is to apply the full force and might of our military, and we 
are prepared to do so. If Saddam Hussein attempts to cling to power, he will 
remain a deadly foe until the end. In desperation, he and terrorists groups 
might try to conduct terrorist operations against the American people and our 
friends. These attacks are not inevitable. They are, however, possible. And this 
very fact underscores the reason we cannot live under the
threat of blackmail. The terrorist threat to America and the world will be 
diminished the moment that Saddam Hussein is disarmed.Our government is on heightened 
watch against these dangers. Just as we are preparing to ensure victory in Iraq, 
we are taking further actions to protect our homeland. In recent days, American 
authorities have expelled from the country certain individuals with ties to 
Iraqi intelligence services. Among other measures, I have directed additional 
security of our airports, and increased Coast Guard patrols of major seaports. 
The Department of Homeland Security is working closely
with the nation's governors to increase armed security at critical facilities 
across America.Should enemies strike our country, 
they would be attempting to shift our attention with panic and weaken our morale 
with fear. In this, they would fail. No act of theirs can alter the course or 
shake the resolve of this country. We are a peaceful people -- yet we're not a 
fragile people, and we will not be intimidated by thugs and killers. If our 
enemies dare to strike us, they and all who have aided them, will face fearful 
consequences.We are now acting because the risks 
of inaction would be far greater. In one year, or five years, the power of Iraq 
to inflict harm on all free nations would be multiplied many times over. With 
these capabilities, Saddam Hussein and his terrorist allies could choose the 
moment of deadly conflict when they are strongest. We choose to meet that threat 
now, where it arises, before it can appear suddenly in our skies and cities.The cause of peace requires all free 
nations to recognize new and undeniable realities. In the 20th century, some 
chose to appease murderous dictators, whose threats were allowed to grow into 
genocide and global war. In this century, when evil men plot chemical, 
biological, and nuclear terror, a policy of appeasement could bring destruction 
of a kind never before seen on this earth.Terrorists and terror states do not 
reveal these threats with fair notice, in formal declarations -- and responding 
to such enemies only after they have struck first is not self-defense; it is 
suicide. The security of the world requires disarming Saddam Hussein now.As we enforce the just demands of 
the world, we will also honor the deepest commitments of our country. Unlike 
Saddam Hussein, we believe the Iraqi people are deserving and capable of human 
liberty. And when the dictator has departed, they can set an example to all the 
Middle East of a vital and peaceful and self-governing nation.The United States, with other 
countries, will work to advance liberty and peace in that region. Our goal will 
not be achieved overnight, but it can come over time. The power and appeal of 
human liberty is felt in every life and every land. And the greatest power of 
freedom is to overcome hatred and violence, and turn the creative gifts of men 
and women to the pursuits of peace.That is the future we choose. Free 
nations have a duty to defend our people by uniting against the violent. And 
tonight, as we have done before, America and our allies accept that 
responsibility.Good night, and may God continue to 
bless America.",eorge bush address nation ultimatim saddam husse nation ultimatum saddam husseindelivered march cross hall white houseaudio addressyour browser support audio pdf authenticity certify

audio.]My fellow citizens, at this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early 
stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people, and to defend 
the world from grave danger.On my orders, coalition forces have begun striking selected targets of military 
importance to undermine Saddam Hussein's ability to wage war. These are opening 
stages of what will be a broad and concerted campaign. More than 35 countries 
are giving crucial support -- from the use of naval and air bases, to help with 
intelligence and logistics, to the deployment of combat units. Every nation in 
this coalition has chosen to bear the duty and share the honor of serving in our 
common defense.To all the men and women of the United States 
Armed Forces now in the Middle East, the peace of a troubled world and the hopes 
of an oppressed people now depend on you. That trust is well placed.The enemies you confront will come to know your 
skill and bravery. The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent 
spirit of the American military. In this conflict, America faces an enemy who 
has no regard for conventions of war or rules of morality. Saddam Hussein has 
placed Iraqi troops and equipment in civilian areas, attempting to use innocent 
men, women and children as shields for his own military -- a final atrocity 
against his people.I want Americans and all the world to know that 
coalition forces will make every effort to spare innocent civilians from harm. A 
campaign on the harsh terrain of a nation as large as California could be longer 
and more difficult than some predict. And helping Iraqis achieve a united, 
stable, and free country will require our sustained commitment.We come to Iraq with respect for its citizens, 
for their great civilization, and for the religious faiths they practice. We have 
no ambition in Iraq, except to remove a threat and restore control of that 
country to its own people.I know that the families of our military are 
praying that all those who serve will return safely and soon. Millions of 
Americans are praying with you for the safety of your loved ones and for the 
protection of the innocent. For your sacrifice, you have the gratitude and 
respect of the American people. And you can know that our forces will be coming 
home as soon as their work is done.Our nation enters this conflict reluctantly -- 
yet, our purpose is sure. The people of the United States and our friends and 
allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace 
with weapons of mass murder. We will meet that threat now, with our Army, Air 
Force, Navy, Coast Guard and Marines, so that we do not have to meet it later 
with armies of fire fighters and police and doctors on the streets of our 
cities.Now that conflict has come, the only way to limit 
its duration is to apply decisive force. And I assure you, this will not be a 
campaign of half measures, and we will accept no outcome but victory.My fellow citizens, the dangers to our country 
and the world will be overcome. We will pass through this time of peril and 
carry on the work of peace. We will defend our freedom. We will bring freedom to

Peoples of Iraq (4-10-0","President Bush:This is George W Bush, the President of the 
United States. At this moment, the regime of Saddam Hussein is being removed 
from power, and a long era of fear and cruelty is ending. American and coalition 
forces are now operating inside Baghdad -- and we will not stop until Saddams 
corrupt gang is gone. The government of Iraq, and the future of your country, 
will soon belong to you.The goals of our coalition are clear and limited. 
We will end a brutal regime, whose aggression and weapons of mass destruction 
make it a unique threat to the world. Coalition forces will help maintain law 
and order, so that Iraqis can live in security. We will respect your great 
religious traditions, whose principles of equality and compassion are essential 
to Iraqs future. We will help you build a peaceful and representative 
government that protects the rights of all citizens. And then our military 
forces will leave. Iraq will go forward as a unified, independent, and sovereign 
nation that has regained a respected place in the world.The United States and its coalition partners 
respect the people of Iraq. We are taking unprecedented measures to spare the 
lives of innocent Iraqi citizens. We are beginning to deliver food and water and 
medicine to those in need. Our only enemy is Saddam and his
brutal regime -- and that regime is your enemy as well.In the new era that is coming to Iraq, your country will no longer be held 
captive to the will of a cruel dictator. You will be free, free to build a better 
life, instead of building more palaces for Saddam and his sons, free to pursue 
economic prosperity without the hardship of economic sanctions, free to travel 
and free speak your mind, free to join in the political affairs of Iraq. And all the 
people who make up your country -- Kurds, Shia, Turkomans, Sunnis, and others -- 
will be free of the terrible persecution that so many have endured.The nightmare that Saddam Hussein has brought to your nation will soon be over. 
You are a good and gifted people -- the heirs of a great civilization that 
contributes to all humanity. You deserve better than tyranny and corruption and 
torture chambers. You deserve to live as free people. And I assure every citizen 
of Iraq: Your nation will soon be free.Thank you.Prime Minister Blair:I'm glad to be able to speak to you 
today to tell you that Saddam Hussein's regime is collapsing; that the years 
of brutality, oppression, and fear are coming to an end; that a new and better 
future beckons for the people of Iraq.We did not want this war. But in 
refusing to give up his weapons of mass destruction, Saddam gave us no choice 
but to act. Now that the war has begun, it will be seen through to the end. We will 
continue to do all we can to avoid civilian casualties. Our enemy is Saddam and 
his regime, not the Iraqi people. Our forces are friends and liberators of the 
Iraqi people, not your conquerors. And they will not stay a day longer in Iraq than is 
necessary.I know, however, that some of you feared a repeat of 1991, when you thought Saddam's rule 
was being ended, but he stayed, and you suffered. That will not happen this 
time. This regime will be gone, and ended. And then we will work with you to build the 
peaceful, prosperous Iraq that you want, and that you deserve. And this Iraq will not be 
run by Britain, or by the United States, or by the United Nations. It will be run by you, the people of 
Iraq.Our aim is to help alleviate 
immediate humanitarian suffering, and to move as soon as possible to an interim 
authority that is run by Iraqis. That, in turn, will pave the way for a truly representative Iraqi 
government, which respects human rights and the rule of law and spends Iraq's 
wealth not on palaces and weapons of mass destruction, but on you and the 
services you need. Saddam Hussein and his regime plundered your nation's wealth. 
While many of you live in poverty, they lived lives of luxury. Saddam 
became one of the richest men in the world; his money stolen from you, the Iraqi 
people.The money from Iraqi oil will be 
yours; to be used to build prosperity for you and your families.I know too from my meetings with 
Iraqi exiles who live in Britain that you are an inventive, creative people. You 
should be free to travel, free to have access to independent media, free to 
express your views, free to develop your culture.My experience of people the world 
over is that we all want to be able to live our lives in peace and security; we 
all want to give our families the chance of a decent life and a future. For years, 
that chance has been denied to you. Millions of your countrymen and women have 
been forced to leave. Many thousands have been murdered, tortured, brutalized by 
the regime. Now we want to give you the chance 
to rebuild your country; to rebuild your lives; to give your families a chance 
of that better future.So it is in the spirit of friendship and goodwill that we 
now offer our help.Thank you.",president bush george w bush president unite state moment regime saddam hussein remove power long era fear cruelty end american coalition force operate inside baghdad stop corrupt gang go government iraq future country soon belong goal coalition clear limit end brutal regime whose aggression weapon mass destruction make unique threat world coalition force help maintain law order iraqi live security respect great religious tradition whose principle equality compassion essential future help build peaceful representative government protect right citizen military force leave iraq go forward unify independent sovereign nation regain respect place unite state coalition partner respect people iraq take unprecedented measure spare live innocent iraqi citizen begin deliver food water medicine need enemy saddam brutal regime regime enemy new era come iraq country longer hold captive cruel dictator free free build better life instead build palace saddam son free pursue economic prosperity without hardship economic sanction free travel free speak mind free join political affair iraq people make country kurd turkoman sunni others free terrible persecution many nightmare saddam hussein bring nation soon good gift people heir great civilization contribute humanity deserve better tyranny corruption torture chamber deserve live free people assure every citizen iraq nation soon minister blair glad able speak today tell saddam hussein regime collapse year brutality oppression fear come end new better future beckon people want war refuse give weapon mass destruction saddam give u choice act war begin see end continue avoid civilian casualty enemy saddam regime iraqi people force friend liberator iraqi people conqueror stay day longer iraq know however fear repeat think saddam rule end stay suffer happen time regime go end work build peaceful prosperous iraq want deserve iraq run britain unite state unite nation run people aim help alleviate immediate humanitarian suffer move soon possible interim authority run iraqi turn pave way truly representative iraqi government respect human right rule law spend iraq wealth palace weapon mass destruction service need saddam hussein regime plunder nation wealth many live poverty live live luxury saddam become one richest men world money steal iraqi money iraqi oil use build prosperity know meet iraqi exile live britain inventive creative people free travel free access independent medium free express view free develop experience people world want able live live peace security want give family chance decent life future year chance deny million countryman woman force leave many thousand murder torture brutalize regime want give chance rebuild country rebuild live give family chance better spirit friendship goodwill offer,president bush george president state moment regime saddam hussein power fear cruelty end coalition force operate baghdad stop corrupt gang government country goal coalition limit end brutal regime aggression mass destruction threat world coalition force help law order security respect tradition principle equality compassion future help government protect force sovereign nation regain place state coalition partner people measure innocent iraqi citizen begin food water medicine enemy regime regime era country cruel dictator build life palace son pursue prosperity sanction travel speak mind join affair people country sunni others persecution hussein nation gift people civilization contribute humanity corruption torture chamber people citizen iraq nation minister blair speak today regime collapse year brutality oppression beckon people war refuse weapon mass destruction choice act war end casualty enemy saddam regime people liberator people day iraq repeat saddam rule end stay time regime work build iraq deserve iraq state nation run people help suffer move authority way government respect right rule law wealth palace mass destruction service hussein regime plunder nation poverty luxury men world money steal money iraqi oil use build prosperity meet britain people travel access medium express view experience people world peace security family chance life year chance deny countryman woman force murder torture regime chance country family chance spirit friendship goodwill offer

USS Abraham Lincoln, off the coast of San Diego, CAAudio mp3 of 
AddressPlug-in required for flash audioYour browser does not support the audio element.click 
for pdfBe seated, please. Thank you. Thank you all very much.Admiral Kelly, Captain Card, officers and sailors of 
the USS Abraham Lincoln, my fellow Americans: Major combat operations in Iraq 
have ended. In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have 
prevailed. And now our coalition is engaged in securing and reconstructing that 
country.In this battle, we have fought for the cause of liberty, and for the peace of 
the world. Our nation and our coalition are proud of this accomplishment -- yet, 
it is you, the members of the United States military, who achieved it. Your 
courage, your willingness to face danger for your country and for each other, 
made this day possible. Because of you, our nation is more secure. Because of 
you, the tyrant has fallen, and Iraq is free.Operation Iraqi Freedom was carried out with a combination of precision and 
speed and boldness the enemy did not expect, and the world had not seen before. 
From distant bases or ships at sea, we sent planes and missiles that could 
destroy an enemy division, or strike a single bunker. Marines and soldiers 
charged to Baghdad across 350 miles of hostile ground, in one of the swiftest 
advances of heavy arms in history. You have shown the world the skill and the 
might of the American Armed Forces.This nation thanks all the members of our coalition who joined in a noble 
cause. We thank the Armed Forces of the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland, 
who shared in the hardships of war. We thank all the citizens of Iraq who 
welcomed our troops and joined in the liberation of their own country. And 
tonight, I have a special word for Secretary Rumsfeld, for General Franks, and 
for all the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States: America is 
grateful for a job well done.The character of our military through history -- the daring of Normandy, the 
fierce courage of Iwo Jima, the decency and idealism that turned enemies into 
allies -- is fully present in this generation. When Iraqi civilians looked into 
the faces of our servicemen and women, they saw strength and kindness and 
goodwill. When I look at the members of the United States military, I see the 
best of our country, and I'm honored to be your Commander-in-Chief.In the images of falling statues, we have witnessed the arrival of a new era. 
For a hundred of years of war, culminating in the nuclear age, military 
technology was designed and deployed to inflict casualties on an ever-growing 
scale. In defeating Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, Allied forces destroyed 
entire cities, while enemy leaders who started the conflict were safe until the 
final days. Military power was used to end a regime by breaking a nation.Today, we have the greater power to free a nation by breaking a dangerous and 
aggressive regime. With new tactics and precision weapons, we can achieve 
military objectives without directing violence against civilians. No device of 
man can remove the tragedy from war; yet it is a great moral advance when the 
guilty have far more to fear from war than the innocent.In the images of celebrating Iraqis, we have also seen the ageless appeal of 
human freedom. Decades of lies and intimidation could not make the Iraqi people 
love their oppressors or desire their own enslavement. Men and women in every 
culture need liberty like they need food and water and air. Everywhere that 
freedom arrives, humanity rejoices; and everywhere that freedom stirs, let 
tyrants fear.We have difficult work to do in Iraq. We're bringing order to parts of that 
country that remain dangerous. We're pursuing and finding leaders of the old 
regime, who will be held to account for their crimes. We've begun the search for 
hidden chemical and biological weapons and already know of hundreds of sites 
that will be investigated. We're helping to rebuild Iraq, where the dictator 
built palaces for himself, instead of hospitals and schools. And we will stand 
with the new leaders of Iraq as they establish a government of, by, and for the 
Iraqi people.The transition from dictatorship to democracy will take time, but it is worth 
every effort. Our coalition will stay until our work is done. Then we will 
leave, and we will leave behind a free Iraq.The battle of Iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on September 
the 11, 2001 -- and still goes on. That terrible morning, 19 evil men -- the 
shock troops of a hateful ideology -- gave America and the civilized world a 
glimpse of their ambitions. They imagined, in the words of one terrorist, that 
September the 11th would be the ""beginning of the end of America."" By seeking to 
turn our cities into killing fields, terrorists and their allies believed that 
they could destroy this nation's resolve, and force our retreat from the world. 
They have failed.In the battle of Afghanistan, we destroyed the Taliban, many terrorists, and 
the camps where they trained. We continue to help the Afghan people lay roads, 
restore hospitals, and educate all of their children. Yet we also have dangerous 
work to complete. As I speak, a Special Operations task force, led by the 82nd 
Airborne, is on the trail of the terrorists and those who seek to undermine the 
free government of Afghanistan. America and our coalition will finish what we 
have begun.From Pakistan to the Philippines to the Horn of Africa, we are hunting down 
al Qaeda killers. Nineteen months ago, I pledged that the terrorists would not 
escape the patient justice of the United States. And as of tonight, nearly 
one-half of al Qaeda's senior operatives have been captured or killed.The liberation of Iraq is a crucial advance in the campaign against terror. 
We've removed an ally of al Qaeda, and cut off a source of terrorist funding. 
And this much is certain: No terrorist network will gain weapons of mass 
destruction from the Iraqi regime, because the regime is no more.In these 19 months that changed the world, our actions have been focused and 
deliberate and proportionate to the offense. We have not forgotten the victims 
of September the 11th -- the last phone calls, the cold murder of children, the 
searches in the rubble. With those attacks, the terrorists and their supporters 
declared war on the United States. And war is what they got.Our war against terror is proceeding according to principles that I have made 
clear to all: Any person involved in committing or planning terrorist attacks 
against the American people becomes an enemy of this country, and a target of 
American justice. Any person, organization, or government that supports, 
protects, or harbors terrorists is complicit in the murder of the innocent, and 
equally guilty of terrorist crimes. Any outlaw regime that has ties to terrorist 
groups and seeks or possesses weapons of mass destruction is a grave danger to 
the civilized world -- and will be confronted. And anyone in the world, 
including the Arab world, who works and sacrifices for freedom has a loyal 
friend in the United States of America.Our commitment to liberty is America's tradition -- declared at our founding; 
affirmed in Franklin Roosevelt's Four Freedoms; asserted in the Truman Doctrine 
and in Ronald Reagan's challenge to an evil empire. We are committed to freedom 
in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and in a peaceful Palestine. The advance of freedom is 
the surest strategy to undermine the appeal of terror in the world. Where 
freedom takes hold, hatred gives way to hope. When freedom takes hold, men and 
women turn to the peaceful pursuit of a better life. American values and 
American interests lead in the same direction: We stand for human liberty.The United States upholds these principles of security and freedom in many 
ways -- with all the tools of diplomacy, law enforcement, intelligence, and 
finance. We're working with a broad coalition of nations that understand the 
threat and our shared responsibility to meet it. The use of force has been -- 
and remains -- our last resort. Yet all can know, friend and foe alike, that our 
nation has a mission: We will answer threats to our security, and we will defend 
the peace.Our mission continues. Al Qaeda is wounded, not destroyed. The scattered 
cells of the terrorist network still operate in many nations, and we know from 
daily intelligence that they continue to plot against free people. The 
proliferation of deadly weapons remains a serious danger. The enemies of freedom 
are not idle, and neither are we. Our government has taken unprecedented 
measures to defend the homeland. And we will continue to hunt down the enemy 
before he can strike.The war on terror is not over; yet it is not endless. We do not know the day 
of final victory, but we have seen the turning of the tide. No act of the 
terrorists will change our purpose, or weaken our resolve, or alter their fate. 
Their cause is lost. Free nations will press on to victory.Other nations in history have fought in foreign lands and remained to occupy 
and exploit. Americans, following a battle, want nothing more than to return 
home. And that is your direction tonight. After service in the Afghan -- and 
Iraqi theaters of war -- after 100,000 miles, on the longest carrier deployment 
in recent history, you are homeward bound. Some of you will see new family 
members for the first time -- 150 babies were born while their fathers were on 
the Lincoln. Your families are proud of you, and your nation will welcome you.We are mindful, as well, that some good men and women are not making the 
journey home. One of those who fell, Corporal Jason Mileo, spoke to his parents 
five days before his death. Jason's father said, ""He called us from the center 
of Baghdad, not to brag, but to tell us he loved us. Our son was a soldier.""Every name, every life is a loss to our military, to our nation, and to the 
loved ones who grieve. There's no homecoming for these families. Yet we pray, in 
God's time, their reunion will come.Those we lost were last seen on duty. Their final act on this Earth was to 
fight a great evil and bring liberty to others. All of you -- all in this 
generation of our military -- have taken up the highest calling of history. 
You're defending your country, and protecting the innocent from harm. And 
wherever you go, you carry a message of hope -- a message that is ancient and 
ever new. In the words of the prophet Isaiah, ""To the captives, 'come out,' -- 
and to those in darkness, 'be free.'""Thank you for serving our country and our cause. May God bless you all, and 
may God continue to bless America.",end combat operation iraq end major combat operation iraqdelivered may us abraham lincoln coast san diego caaudio require flash audioyour browser support audio

37,08 December 2003,>George W. Bush - United Nations 2003 Addre,"Mr. Secretary General; Mr. President; distinguished delegates; ladies 
		and gentlemen:Twenty-four months ago -- and yesterday in the memory of 
		America -- the center of New York City became a battlefield, and a 
		graveyard, and the symbol of an unfinished war. Since that day, 
		terrorists have struck in Bali, Mombassa, in Casablanca, in Riyadh, in 
		Jakarta, in Jerusalem -- measuring the advance of their cause in the 
		chaos and innocent suffering they leave behind.Last 
		month, terrorists brought their war to the United Nations itself. The 
		U.N. headquarters in Baghdad stood for order and compassion -- and for 
		that reason, the terrorists decided it must be destroyed. Among the 22 
		people who were murdered was Sergio Vieira de Mello. Over the decades, 
		this good and brave man from Brazil gave help to the afflicted in 
		Bangladesh, Cyprus, Mozambique, Lebanon, Cambodia, Central Africa, 
		Kosovo, and East Timor, and was aiding the people of Iraq in their time 
		of need. America joins you, his colleagues, in honoring the memory of 
		Senor Vieira de Mello, and the memory of all who died with him in the 
		service to the United Nations.By the victims they choose, and by the means they use, the terrorists 
		have clarified the struggle we are in. Those who target relief workers 
		for death have set themselves against all humanity. Those who incite 
		murder and celebrate suicide reveal their contempt for life, itself. 
		They have no place in any religious faith; they have no claim on the 
		world's sympathy; and they should have no friend in this chamber.Events during the past two years have set before us the clearest of 
		divides: between those who seek order, and those who spread chaos; 
		between those who work for peaceful change, and those who adopt the 
		methods of gangsters; between those who honor the rights of man, and 
		those who deliberately take the lives of men and women and children 
		without mercy or shame.Between these alternatives there is no neutral ground. All governments 
		that support terror are complicit in a war against civilization. No 
		government should ignore the threat of terror, because to look the other 
		way gives terrorists the chance to regroup and recruit and prepare. And 
		all nations that fight terror, as if the lives of their own people 
		depend on it, will earn the favorable judgment of history.The former regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq knew these alternatives, and 
		made their choices. The Taliban was a sponsor and servant of terrorism. 
		When confronted, that regime chose defiance, and that regime is no more. 
		Afghanistan's President, who is here today, now represents a free people 
		who are building a decent and just society; they're building a nation 
		fully joined in the war against terror.The regime of Saddam Hussein cultivated ties to terror while it built 
		weapons of mass destruction. It used those weapons in acts of mass 
		murder, and refused to account for them when confronted by the world. 
		The Security Council was right to be alarmed. The Security Council was 
		right to demand that Iraq destroy its illegal weapons and prove that it 
		had done so. The Security Council was right to vow serious consequences 
		if Iraq refused to comply. And because there were consequences, because 
		a coalition of nations acted to defend the peace, and the credibility of 
		the United Nations, Iraq is free, and today we are joined by 
		representatives of a liberated country.Saddam Hussein's monuments have been removed and not only his statues. 
		The true monuments of his rule and his character -- the torture 
		chambers, and the rape rooms, and the prison cells for innocent children 
		-- are closed. And as we discover the killing fields and mass graves of 
		Iraq, the true scale of Saddam's cruelty is being revealed.The Iraqi people are meeting hardships and challenges, like every nation 
		that has set out on the path of democracy. Yet their future promises 
		lives of dignity and freedom, and that is a world away from the squalid, 
		vicious tyranny they have known. Across Iraq, life is being improved by 
		liberty. Across the Middle East, people are safer because an unstable 
		aggressor has been removed from power. Across the world, nations are 
		more secure because an ally of terror has fallen.Our actions in Afghanistan and Iraq were supported by many governments, 
		and America is grateful to each one. I also recognize that some of the 
		sovereign nations of this assembly disagreed with our actions. Yet there 
		was, and there remains, unity among us on the fundamental principles and 
		objectives of the United Nations. We are dedicated to the defense of our 
		collective security, and to the advance of human rights. These permanent 
		commitments call us to great work in the world, work we must do 
		together. So let us move forward.First, we must stand with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq as they 
		build free and stable countries. The terrorists and their allies fear 
		and fight this progress above all, because free people embrace hope over 
		resentment, and choose peace over violence.The United Nations has been a friend of the Afghan people, distributing 
		food and medicine, helping refugees return home, advising on a new 
		constitution, and helping to prepare the way for nationwide elections. 
		NATO has taken over the U.N.-mandated security force in Kabul. American 
		and coalition forces continue to track and defeat al Qaeda terrorists 
		and remnants of the Taliban. Our efforts to rebuild that country go on. 
		I have recently proposed to spend an additional $1.2 billion for the 
		Afghan reconstruction effort, and I urge other nations to continue 
		contributing to this important cause.In the nation of Iraq, the United Nations is carrying out vital and 
		effective work every day. By the end of 2004, more than 90 percent of 
		Iraqi children under age five will have been immunized against 
		preventable diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and measles, thanks to 
		the hard work and high ideals of UNICEF. Iraq's food distribution system 
		is operational, delivering nearly a half-million tons of food per month, 
		thanks to the skill and expertise of the World Food Program.Our international coalition in Iraq is meeting it responsibilities. We 
		are conducting precision raids against terrorists and holdouts of the 
		former regime. These killers are at war with the Iraqi people. They have 
		made Iraq the central front in the war on terror, and they will be 
		defeated. Our coalition has made sure that Iraq's former dictator will 
		never again use weapons of mass destruction. We are interviewing Iraqi 
		citizens and analyzing records of the old regime to reveal the full 
		extent of its weapons programs and its long campaign of deception. We're 
		training Iraqi police and border guards and a new army, so the Iraqi 
		people can assume full responsibility for their own security.And at the same time, our coalition is helping to improve the daily 
		lives of the Iraqi people. The old regime built palaces while letting 
		schools decay, so we are rebuilding more than a thousand schools. The 
		old regime starved hospitals of resources, so we have helped to supply 
		and reopen hospitals across Iraq. The old regime built up armies and 
		weapons, while allowing the nation's infrastructure to crumble, so we 
		are rehabilitating power plants, water and sanitation facilities, 
		bridges and airports. I proposed to Congress that the United States 
		provide additional funding for our work in Iraq, the greatest financial 
		commitment of its kind since the Marshall Plan. Having helped to 
		liberate Iraq, we will honor our pledges to Iraq, and by helping the 
		Iraqi people build a stable and peaceful country, we will make our own 
		countries more secure.The primary goal of our coalition in Iraq is self-government for the 
		people of Iraq, reached by orderly and democratic process. This process 
		must unfold according to the needs of Iraqis, neither hurried, nor 
		delayed by the wishes of other parties. And the United Nations can 
		contribute greatly to the cause of Iraq self-government. America is 
		working with friends and allies on a new Security Council resolution, 
		which will expand the U.N.'s role in Iraq. As in the aftermath of other 
		conflicts, the United Nations should assist in developing a 
		constitution, in training civil servants, and conducting free and fair 
		elections.Iraq now has a Governing Council, the first truly representative 
		institution in that country. Iraq's new leaders are showing the openness 
		and tolerance that democracy requires, and they're also showing courage. 
		Yet every young democracy needs the help of friends. Now the nation of 
		Iraq needs and deserves our aid, and all nations of goodwill should step 
		forward and provide that support.The success of a free Iraq will be watched and noted throughout the 
		region. Millions will see that freedom, equality, and material progress 
		are possible at the heart of the Middle East. Leaders in the region will 
		face the clearest evidence that free institutions and open societies are 
		the only path to long-term national success and dignity. And a 
		transformed Middle East would benefit the entire world, by undermining 
		the ideologies that export violence to other lands.Iraq as a dictatorship had great power to destabilize the Middle East; 
		Iraq as a democracy will have great power to inspire the Middle East. 
		The advance of democratic institutions in Iraq is setting an example 
		that others, including the Palestinian people, would be wise to follow. 
		The Palestinian cause is betrayed by leaders who cling to power by 
		feeding old hatreds and destroying the good work of others. The 
		Palestinian people deserve their own state, and they will gain that 
		state by embracing new leaders committed to reform, to fighting terror, 
		and to building peace. All parties in the Middle East must meet their 
		responsibilities and carry out the commitments they made at Aqaba. 
		Israel must work to create the conditions that will allow a peaceful 
		Palestinian state to emerge. And Arab nations must cut off funding and 
		other support for terrorist organizations. America will work with every 
		nation in the region that acts boldly for the sake of peace.A second challenge we must confront together is the proliferation of 
		weapons of mass destruction. Outlaw regimes that possess nuclear, 
		chemical and biological weapons -- and the means to deliver them -- 
		would be able to use blackmail and create chaos in entire regions. These 
		weapons could be used by terrorists to bring sudden disaster and 
		suffering on a scale we can scarcely imagine. The deadly combination of 
		outlaw regimes and terror networks and weapons of mass murder is a peril 
		that cannot be ignored or wished away. If such a danger is allowed to 
		fully materialize, all words, all protests, will come too late. Nations 
		of the world must have the wisdom and the will to stop grave threats 
		before they arrive.One crucial step is to secure the most dangerous materials at their 
		source. For more than a decade, the United States has worked with Russia 
		and other states of the former Soviet Union to dismantle, destroy, or 
		secure weapons and dangerous materials left over from another era. Last 
		year in Canada, the G8 nations agreed to provide up to $20 billion -- 
		half of it from the United States -- to fight this proliferation risk 
		over the next 10 years. Since then, six additional countries have joined 
		the effort. More are needed, and I urge other nations to help us meet 
		this danger.We're also improving our capability to interdict lethal materials in 
		transit. Through our Proliferation Security Initiative, 11 nations are 
		preparing to search planes and ships, trains and trucks carrying suspect 
		cargo, and to seize weapons or missile shipments that raise 
		proliferation concerns. These nations have agreed on a set of 
		interdiction principles, consistent with legal -- current legal 
		authorities. And we're working to expand the Proliferation Security 
		Initiative to other countries. We're determined to keep the world's most 
		destructive weapons away from all our shores, and out of the hands of 
		our common enemies.Because proliferators will use any route or channel that is open to 
		them, we need the broadest possible cooperation to stop them. Today, I 
		ask the U.N. Security Council to adopt a new anti-proliferation 
		resolution. This resolution should call on all members of the U.N. to 
		criminalize the proliferation of weapons -- weapons of mass destruction, 
		to enact strict export controls consistent with international standards, 
		and to secure any and all sensitive materials within their own borders. 
		The United States stands ready to help any nation draft these new laws, 
		and to assist in their enforcement.A third challenge we share is a challenge to our conscience. We must act 
		decisively to meet the humanitarian crises of our time. The United 
		States has begun to carry out the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, aimed 
		at preventing AIDS on a massive scale, and treating millions who have 
		the disease already. We have pledged $15 billion over five years to 
		fight AIDS around the world.My country is acting to save lives from famine, as well. We're providing 
		more than $1.4 billion in global emergency food aid, and I've asked our 
		United States Congress for $200 million for a new famine fund, so we can 
		act quickly when the first signs of famine appear. Every nation on every 
		continent should generously add their resources to the fight against 
		disease and desperate hunger.There's another humanitarian crisis spreading, yet hidden from view. 
		Each year, an estimated 800,000 to 900,000 human beings are bought, sold 
		or forced across the world's borders. Among them are hundreds of 
		thousands of teenage girls, and others as young as five, who fall victim 
		to the sex trade. This commerce in human life generates billions of 
		dollars each year -- much of which is used to finance organized crime.There's a special evil in the abuse and exploitation of the most 
		innocent and vulnerable. The victims of sex trade see little of life 
		before they see the very worst of life -- an underground of brutality 
		and lonely fear. Those who create these victims and profit from their 
		suffering must be severely punished. Those who patronize this industry 
		debase themselves and deepen the misery of others. And governments that 
		tolerate this trade are tolerating a form of slavery.This problem has appeared in my own country, and we are working to stop 
		it. The PROTECT Act, which I signed into law this year, makes it a crime 
		for any person to enter the United States, or for any citizen to travel 
		abroad, for the purpose of sex tourism involving children. The 
		Department of Justice is actively investigating sex tour operators and 
		patrons, who can face up to 30 years in prison. Under the Trafficking 
		Victims Protection Act, the United States is using sanctions against 
		governments to discourage human trafficking.The victims of this industry also need help from members of the United 
		Nations. And this begins with clear standards and the certainty of 
		punishment under laws of every country. Today, some nations make it a 
		crime to sexually abuse children abroad. Such conduct should be a crime 
		in all nations. Governments should inform travelers of the harm this 
		industry does, and the severe punishments that will fall on its patrons. 
		The American government is committing $50 million to support the good 
		work of organizations that are rescuing women and children from 
		exploitation, and giving them shelter and medical treatment and the hope 
		of a new life. I urge other governments to do their part.We must show new energy in fighting back an old evil. Nearly two 
		centuries after the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, and more 
		than a century after slavery was officially ended in its last 
		strongholds, the trade in human beings for any purpose must not be 
		allowed to thrive in our time.All the challenges I have spoken of this morning require urgent 
		attention and moral clarity. Helping Afghanistan and Iraq to succeed as 
		free nations in a transformed region, cutting off the avenues of 
		proliferation, abolishing modern forms of slavery -- these are the kinds 
		of great tasks for which the United Nations was founded. In each case, 
		careful discussion is needed, and also decisive action. Our good 
		intentions will be credited only if we achieve good outcomes.As an original signer of the U.N. Charter, the United States of America 
		is committed to the United Nations. And we show that commitment by 
		working to fulfill the U.N.'s stated purposes, and give meaning to its 
		ideals. The founding documents of the United Nations and the founding 
		documents of America stand in the same tradition. Both assert that human 
		beings should never be reduced to objects of power or commerce, because 
		their dignity is inherent. Both require -- both recognize a moral law 
		that stands above men and nations, which must be defended and enforced 
		by men and nations. And both point the way to peace, the peace that 
		comes when all are free. We secure that peace with our courage, and we 
		must show that courage together.May God bless you all.",secretary general president distinguish delegate lady gentleman month ago yesterday memory america center new york city become battlefield

38,14 December 2003,>George W. Bush - Address to the Australian Parliament (text-audio-vide,"Governor General Michael Jeffery,Prime Minister 
John Howard, Speaker of the House, Leader of the Senate,Leader of the 
Opposition Simon Crean, Distinguished Members of the House and the Senate, 
Premiers, Members of the Diplomatic Corps, ladies and gentlemen:Laura and I are honored to be in the Commonwealth 
of Australia. I want to thank the Prime Minister for his invitation. I want to 
thank the Members and Senators for convening this session of the Parliament. And 
I want to thank the people of Australia for a gracious welcome.Five months ago, your 
Prime Minister was a distinguished visitor of ours in Crawford, Texas, at our 
ranch. You might remember that I called him a ""man of steel."" That's Texan for 
""fair dinkum."" Prime Minister John Howard is a leader of exceptional courage, 
who exemplifies the finest qualities of one of the world's greatest democracies. 
Proud to call him friend.Americans know Australia as a land of independent and enterprising and 
good-hearted people. We see something familiar here, something we like. 
Australians are fair-minded and tolerant and easy-going. Yet in times of trouble 
and danger, Australians are the first to step forward, to accept the hard 
duties, and to fight bravely until the fighting is done.In a hundred years of experience, American 
soldiers have come to know the courage and good fellowship of the diggers at 
their side. We fought together in theBattle of Hamel, together in the Coral 
Sea, together in New Guinea, on the Korean Peninsula, in Vietnam. And in the war 
on terror, once again we're at each other's side.In this war, the Australia and American people have witnessed the methods of the 
enemy. We saw the scope of their hatred onSeptember the 11th, 2001. We saw the 
depth of their cruelty onOctober the 12th, 2002. We saw destruction and grief -- 
and we saw our duty. As free nations in peril, we must fight this enemy with all 
our strength.No country can live -- live peacefully in a world that the 
terrorists would make for us. And no people are immune from the sudden violence 
that can come to an office building, or an airplane, or a night club, or a city 
bus. Your nation and mine have known the shock and felt the sorrow and laid the 
dead to rest. And we refuse to live our lives at the mercy of murderers.The nature of the terrorist threat defines the 
strategy we are using to -- to fight it. These committed killers will not be stopped 
by negotiations. They will not respond to reason. The terrorists cannot be 
appeased. They must be found; they must be fought; and they must be defeated.The terrorists hide and strike within free societies, so we're draining their 
funds, disrupting their plans, finding their leaders. The skilled work of Thai 
and Indonesia and other authorities in capturing the terroristHambali-- 
suspected of planning the murders in Bali and other attacks -- was a model of 
the determined campaign we are waging.The terrorists seek safe harbor to plot and to train -- so we're holding the 
allies of terror to account. America, Australia, and other nations acted in 
Afghanistan to destroy the home base of al-Qaeda and rid that country of a 
terror regime. And the Afghan people, especially Afghan women, do not miss 
the bullying and the beatings and the public executions at the hands of the 
Taliban.The terrorists hope to gain chemical, biological, 
or nuclear weapons -- the means to match their hatred, so we're confronting 
outlaw regimes that aid terrorists, that pursue weapons of mass destruction, and 
that defy the demands of the world. America, Australia, and other nations acted 
in Iraq to remove a grave and gathering danger, instead of wishing and waiting 
while tragedy drew closer.Since the liberation of Iraq, we have discovered 
Saddam'sclandestine network of biological laboratories,the design work on 
prohibited long-range missiles, his elaborate campaign to hide illegal weapons 
programs.1Saddam Hussein spent years frustrating U.N. inspections for a simple 
reason -- because he was violating U.N. demands. And in the end, rather than 
surrender his programs and abandon his lies, he chose defiance, and his own 
undoing.Who can possibly think that the world would be better off with Saddam Hussein 
still in power? Surely not the dissidents who would be in his prisons, or end up 
in his mass graves; surely not the men and women who would fill Saddam's torture 
chambers and rape rooms; surely not the families of the victims he murdered with 
poison gas; surely not anyone who cares about human rights and democracy and 
stability in the Middle East. Today, Saddam's regime is gone, and no one --[audience interruption]Speaker Andrew:Senator Brown, I warn you -- Senator Brown will excuse himself 
from the House. Senator Brown will excuse himself from the House. The Sergeant 
will remove Senator Brown from the House.President Bush:Surely no one 
--Speaker Andrew:Mr. President --President Bush: --who cares 
about human rights and democracy and stability in the Middle East. Today Saddam 
Hussein's regime is gone, and no one should mourn its passing.In the months leading up to our action in Iraq, Australia and America went to 
the United Nations. We are committed to multilateral institutions because global 
threats require a global response. We're committed to collective security, and 
collective security requires more than solemn discussions and sternly worded 
pronouncements. It requires collective will. If the resolutions of the world 
are to be more than ink on paper, they must be enforced. If the institutions of 
the world are to be more than debating societies, they must eventually act.  
If the world promises serious consequences for the defiance of the lawless, then 
serious consequences must follow.Because we enforcedResolution 1441, and used force in Iraq as a last resort, 
there is one more free nation in the world -- and all free nations are more 
secure.We accepted our obligations with open eyes, 
mindful of the sacrifices that had been made, and those to come. The burdens 
fall most heavily on the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families. 
The world has seen the bravery and skill of the Australian military. Your 
Special Operations forces were among the first units on the ground in Iraq. And 
in Afghanistan the first casualty among America's allies was Australian:Special 
Air Service Sergeant Andrew Russell. This afternoon I will lay a wreath at theAustralian War Memorial, in memory of Sergeant Russell, and the long line of 
Australians who have died in the service to this nation.  And my nation 
honors their service to the cause of freedom, to the cause we share.Members and Senators, with decisive victories behind us, we have decisive days 
ahead. We cannot let up on our offensive against terror, even a bit. And we must 
continue to build stability and peace in the Middle East and Asia as the 
alternatives to hatred and fear.We seek the rise of freedom and self-government in Afghanistan and in Iraq for 
the benefit of their people, as an example to their neighbors, and for the 
security of the world. America and Australia are helping the people of both 
those nations to defend themselves, to build the institutions of law and 
democracy, and to establish the beginnings of free enterprise.These are difficult tasks in civil societies wrecked by years of tyranny. And it 
should surprise no one that the remnants and advocates of tyranny should fight 
liberty's advance. The advance of liberty will not be halted.  The 
terrorists and the Taliban and Saddam holdouts are desperately trying to stop 
our progress. They will fail. The people of Afghanistan and Iraq measure 
progress every day. They are losing the habits of fear, and they are gaining the 
habits of freedom.Some are skeptical about the prospects for democracy in the Middle East, and 
wonder if its culture can support free institutions. In fact, freedom has always 
had its skeptics. Some doubted that Japan and other Asian countries could ever 
adopt the ways of self-government. The same doubts have been heard at various 
times about Germans and Africans. At the time of the Magna Cart[a], the English 
were not considered the most promising recruits for democracy. And to be honest, 
sophisticated observers had serious reservations about the scruffy travelers who 
founded our two countries.  Every milestone of liberty was considered 
impossible before it was achieved. In our time, we must decide our own belief: 
Either freedom is the privilege of an elite few, or it is the right and capacity 
of all humanity.By serving our ideals, we also serve our interests. If the Middle East remains a 
place of anger and hopelessness and incitement, this world will tend toward 
division and chaos and violence. Only the spread of freedom and hope in the 
Middle East in the long-term will bring peace to that region and beyond. And the 
liberation of more than 50 million Iraqis and Afghans from tyranny is progress 
to be proud of.Our nations must also confront the immediate threat of proliferation. We cannot 
allow the growing ties of trade and the forces of globalization to be used for 
the secret transport of lethal materials. So our two countries are joining 
together in theProliferation Security Initiative. We're preparing to search 
planes and ships and trains and trucks carrying suspect[ed] cargo, to seize 
weapons or missile shipments that raise proliferation concerns. Last month, 
Australia hosted the first maritime interdiction exercise in the Coral Sea.Australia and the United States are also keeping pressure on Iran to conform to 
its letter and spirit of the nonproliferation obligations. We're working 
together to convince North Korea that the continued pursuit of nuclear weapons 
will bring only further isolation. The wrong weapons, the wrong technology in 
the wrong hands has never been so great a danger -- and we are meeting that 
danger together.Our nations have a special responsibility throughout the Pacific to help keep 
the peace, to ensure the free movement of people and capital and information, 
and advance the ideals of democracy and freedom. America will continue to 
maintain a forward presence in Asia, continue to work closely with Australia.Today, America and Australia are working with Japan 
and the Philippines, Thailand, 
Indonesia, and Singapore, and other nations to expand trade and to fight terror, 
to keep the peace -- the peace in the Taiwan Straits.Your country is hosting President Hu Jintao. Australia's agenda with China is 
the same as my country's. We're encouraged by China's cooperation in the war on 
terror. We're working with China to ensure the Korean Peninsula is free of 
nuclear weapons. We see[k] a China that is stable and prosperous -- a nation that 
respects the peace of its neighbors and works to secure the freedom of its own 
people.Security in the Asia Pacific region will always depend on the willingness of 
nations to take responsibility for their neighborhood, as Australia is doing. 
Your service and your sacrifice helped to establish a new government and a new 
nation in East Timor. And working with New Zealand and other Pacific island 
states, you're helping the Solomon Islands reestablish order and build a just 
government. By your principled actions, Australia is leading the way to peace in 
Southeast Asia  -- and America is grateful.Together -- [audience interruption]Together my country -- Together my country, with Australia,

39,20 January 2004,">George W. Bush - Speech on the Middle East at the National Endowment for 
Democra","Thank you all very 
			much. Please be seated. Thanks for the warm welcome, and thanks for 
			inviting me to join you in this 20th anniversary of the National 
			Endowment for Democracy. The staff and directors of this 
			organization have seen a lot of history over the last two decades, 
			you've been a part of that history. By speaking for and standing for 
			freedom, you've lifted the hopes of people around the world, and 
			you've brought great credit to America.I appreciate Vin 
			for the short introduction. I'm a man who likes short introductions. 
			And he didn't let me down. But more importantly, I appreciate the 
			invitation. I appreciate the members of Congress who are here, 
			senators from both political parties, members of the House of 
			Representatives from both political parties. I appreciate the 
			ambassadors who are here. I appreciate the guests who have come. I 
			appreciate the bipartisan spirit, the nonpartisan spirit of the 
			National Endowment for Democracy. I'm glad that Republicans and 
			Democrats and independents are working together to advance human 
			liberty.The roots of our 
			democracy can be traced to England, and to its Parliament -- and so 
			can the roots of this organization. In June of 1982, President 
			Ronald Reagan spoke at Westminster Palace and declared, the turning 
			point had arrived in history. He argued that Soviet communism had 
			failed, precisely because it did not respect its own people -- their 
			creativity, their genius and their rights.President Reagan said 
			that the day of Soviet tyranny was passing, that freedom had a 
			momentum which would not be halted. He gave this organization its 
			mandate: to add to the momentum of freedom across the world. Your 
			mandate was important 20 years ago; it is equally important today.A number of critics 
			were dismissive of that speech by the President. According to one 
			editorial of the time, ""It seems hard to be a sophisticated European 
			and also an admirer of Ronald Reagan."" Some observers on 
			both sides of the Atlantic pronounced the speech simplistic and 
			naive, and even dangerous. In fact, Ronald Reagan's words were 
			courageous and optimistic and entirely correct.The great democratic 
			movement President Reagan described was already well underway. In 
			the early 1970s, there were about 40 democracies in the world. By 
			the middle of that decade, Portugal and Spain and Greece held free 
			elections. Soon there were new democracies in Latin America, and 
			free institutions were spreading in Korea, in Taiwan, and in East 
			Asia. This very week in 1989, there were protests in East Berlin and 
			in Leipzig. By the end of that year, every communist dictatorship in 
			Central America* had collapsed. Within another year, the South 
			African government released Nelson Mandela. Four years later, he was 
			elected president of his country -- ascending, like Walesa and 
			Havel, from prisoner of state to head of state.As the 20th century 
			ended, there were around 120 democracies in the world -- and I can 
			assure you more are on the way. Ronald Reagan would be pleased, and 
			he would not be surprised.We've witnessed, in 
			little over a generation, the swiftest advance of freedom in the 
			2,500 year story of democracy. Historians in the future will offer 
			their own explanations for why this happened. Yet we already know 
			some of the reasons they will cite. It is no accident that the rise 
			of so many democracies took place in a time when the world's most 
			influential nation was itself a democracy.The United States made 
			military and moral commitments in Europe and Asia, which protected 
			free nations from aggression, and created the conditions in which 
			new democracies could flourish. As we provided security for whole 
			nations, we also provided inspiration for oppressed peoples. In 
			prison camps, in banned union meetings, in clandestine churches, men 
			and women knew that the whole world was not sharing their own 
			nightmare. They knew of at least one place -- a bright and hopeful 
			land -- where freedom was valued and secure. And they prayed that 
			America would not forget them, or forget the mission to promote 
			liberty around the world.Historians will note 
			that in many nations, the advance of markets and free enterprise 
			helped to create a middle class that was confident enough to demand 
			their own rights. They will point to the role of technology in 
			frustrating censorship and central control -- and marvel at the 
			power of instant communications to spread the truth, the news, and 
			courage across borders.Historians in the 
			future will reflect on an extraordinary, undeniable fact: Over time, 
			free nations grow stronger and dictatorships grow weaker. In the 
			middle of the 20th century, some imagined that the central planning 
			and social regimentation were a shortcut to national strength. In 
			fact, the prosperity, and social vitality and technological progress 
			of a people are directly determined by extent of their liberty. 
			Freedom honors and unleashes human creativity -- and creativity 
			determines the strength and wealth of nations. Liberty is both the 
			plan of Heaven for humanity, and the best hope for progress here on 
			Earth.The progress of 
			liberty is a powerful trend. Yet, we also know that liberty, if not 
			defended, can be lost. The success of freedom is not determined by 
			some dialectic of history. By definition, the success of freedom 
			rests upon the choices and the courage of free peoples, and upon 
			their willingness to sacrifice. In the trenches of World War I, 
			through a two-front war in the 1940s, the difficult battles of Korea 
			and Vietnam, and in missions of rescue and liberation on nearly 
			every continent, Americans have amply displayed our willingness to 
			sacrifice for liberty.The sacrifices of 
			Americans have not always been recognized or appreciated, yet they 
			have been worthwhile. Because we and our allies were steadfast, 
			Germany and Japan are democratic nations that no longer threaten the 
			world. A global nuclear standoff with the Soviet Union ended 
			peacefully -- as did the Soviet Union. The nations of Europe are 
			moving towards unity, not dividing into armed camps and descending 
			into genocide. Every nation has learned, or should have learned, an 
			important lesson: Freedom is worth fighting for, dying for, and 
			standing for -- and the advance of freedom leads to peace.And now we must apply 
			that lesson in our own time. We've reached another great turning 
			point -- and the resolve we show will shape the next stage of the 
			world democratic movement.Our commitment to 
			democracy is tested in countries like Cuba and Burma and North Korea 
			and Zimbabwe -- outposts of oppression in our world. The people in 
			these nations live in captivity, and fear and silence. Yet, these 
			regimes cannot hold back freedom forever -- and, one day, from 
			prison camps and prison cells, and from exile, the leaders of new 
			democracies will arrive. Communism, and militarism and rule by the 
			capricious and corrupt are the relics of a passing era. And we will 
			stand with these oppressed peoples until the day of their freedom 
			finally arrives.Our commitment to 
			democracy is tested in China. That nation now has a sliver, a 
			fragment of liberty. Yet, China's people will eventually want their 
			liberty pure and whole. China has discovered that economic freedom 
			leads to national wealth. China's leaders will also discover that 
			freedom is indivisible -- that social and religious freedom is also 
			essential to national greatness and national dignity. Eventually, 
			men and women who are allowed to control their own wealth will 
			insist on controlling their own lives and their own country.Our commitment to 
			democracy is also tested in the Middle East, which is my focus 
			today, and must be a focus of American policy for decades to come. 
			In many nations of the Middle East -- countries of great strategic 
			importance -- democracy has not yet taken root. And the questions 
			arise: Are the peoples of the Middle East somehow beyond the reach 
			of liberty? Are millions of men and women and children condemned by 
			history or culture to live in despotism? Are they alone never to 
			know freedom, and never even to have a choice in the matter? I, for 
			one, do not believe it. I believe every person has the ability and 
			the right to be free.Some skeptics of 
			democracy assert that the traditions of Islam are inhospitable to 
			the representative government. This ""cultural condescension,"" as 
			Ronald Reagan termed it, has a long history. After the Japanese 
			surrender in 1945, a so-called Japan expert asserted that democracy 
			in that former empire would ""never work."" Another observer declared 
			the prospects for democracy in post-Hitler Germany are, and I quote, 
			""most uncertain at best"" -- he made that claim in 1957. Seventy-four 
			years ago, The Sunday London Times declared nine-tenths of the 
			population of India to be ""illiterates not caring a fig for 
			politics."" Yet when Indian democracy was imperiled in the 1970s, the 
			Indian people showed their commitment to liberty in a national 
			referendum that saved their form of government.Time after time, 
			observers have questioned whether this country, or that people, or 
			this group, are ""ready"" for democracy -- as if freedom were a prize 
			you win for meeting our own Western standards of progress. In fact, 
			the daily work of democracy itself is the path of progress. It 
			teaches cooperation, the free exchange of ideas, and the peaceful 
			resolution of differences. As men and women are showing, from 
			Bangladesh to Botswana, to Mongolia, it is the practice of democracy 
			that makes a nation ready for democracy, and every nation can start 
			on this path.It should be clear to 
			all that Islam -- the faith of one-fifth of humanity -- is 
			consistent with democratic rule. Democratic progress is found in 
			many predominantly Muslim countries -- in Turkey and Indonesia, and 
			Senegal and Albania, Niger and Sierra Leone. Muslim men and women 
			are good citizens of India and South Africa, of the nations of 
			Western Europe, and of the United States of America.More than half of all 
			the Muslims in the world live in freedom under democratically 
			constituted governments. They succeed in democratic societies, not 
			in spite of their faith, but because of it. A religion that demands 
			individual moral accountability, and encourages the encounter of the 
			individual with God, is fully compatible with the rights and 
			responsibilities of self-government.Yet there's a great 
			challenge today in the Middle East. In the words of a recent report 
			by Arab scholars, the global wave of democracy has -- and I quote -- 
			""barely reached the Arab states."" They continue: ""This freedom 
			deficit undermines human development and is one of the most painful 
			manifestations of lagging political development."" The freedom 
			deficit they describe has terrible consequences, of the people of 
			the Middle East and for the world. In many Middle Eastern countries, 
			poverty is deep and it is spreading, women lack rights and are 
			denied schooling. Whole societies remain stagnant while the world 
			moves ahead. These are not the failures of a culture or a religion. 
			These are the failures of political and economic doctrines.As the colonial era 
			passed away, the Middle East saw the establishment of many military 
			dictatorships. Some rulers adopted the dogmas of socialism, seized 
			total control of political parties and the media and universities. 
			They allied themselves with the Soviet bloc and with international 
			terrorism. Dictators in Iraq and Syria promised the restoration of 
			national honor, a return to ancient glories. They've left instead a 
			legacy of torture, oppression, misery, and ruin.Other men, and groups 
			of men, have gained influence in the Middle East and beyond through 
			an ideology of theocratic terror. Behind their language of religion 
			is the ambition for absolute political power. Ruling cabals like the 
			Taliban show their version of religious piety in public whippings of 
			women, ruthless suppression of any difference or dissent, and 
			support for terrorists who arm and train to murder the innocent. The 
			Taliban promised religious purity and national pride. Instead, by 
			systematically destroying a proud and working society, they left 
			behind suffering and starvation.Many Middle Eastern 
			governments now understand that military dictatorship and theocratic 
			rule are a straight, smooth highway to nowhere. But some governments 
			still cling to the old habits of central control. There are 
			governments that still fear and repress independent thought and 
			creativity, and private enterprise -- the human qualities that make 
			for a -- strong and successful societies. Even when these nations 
			have vast natural resources, they do not respect or develop their 
			greatest resources -- the talent and energy of men and women working 
			and living in freedom.Instead of dwelling on 
			past wrongs and blaming others, governments in the Middle East need 
			to confront real problems, and serve the true interests of their 
			nations. The good and capable people of the Middle East all deserve 
			responsible leadership. For too long, many people in that region 
			have been victims and subjects -- they deserve to be active 
			citizens.Governments across the 
			Middle East and North Africa are beginning to see the need for 
			change. Morocco has a diverse new parliament; King Mohammed has 
			urged it to extend the rights to women. Here is how His Majesty 
			explained his reforms to parliament: ""How can society achieve 
			progress while women, who represent half the nation, see their 
			rights violated and suffer as a result of injustice, violence, and 
			marginalization, notwithstanding the dignity and justice granted to 
			them by our glorious religion?"" The King of Morocco is correct: The 
			future of Muslim nations will be better for all with the full 
			participation of women.In Bahrain last year, 
			citizens elected their own parliament for the first time in nearly 
			three decades. Oman has extended the vote to all adult citizens; 
			Qatar has a new constitution; Yemen has a multiparty political 
			system; Kuwait has a directly elected national assembly; and Jordan 
			held historic elections this summer. Recent surveys in Arab nations 
			reveal broad support for political pluralism, the rule of law, and 
			free speech. These are the stirrings of Middle Eastern democracy, 
			and they carry the promise of greater change to come.As changes come to the 
			Middle Eastern region, those with power should ask themselves: Will 
			they be remembered for resisting reform, or for leading it? In Iran, 
			the demand for democracy is strong and broad, as we saw last month 
			when thousands gathered to welcome home Shirin Ebadi, the winner of 
			the Nobel Peace Prize. The regime in Teheran must heed the 
			democratic demands of the Iranian people, or lose its last claim to 
			legitimacy.For the Palestinian 
			people, the only path to independence and dignity and progress is 
			the path of democracy. And the Palestinian leaders who block and 
			undermine democratic reform, and feed hatred and encourage violence 
			are not leaders at all. They're the main obstacles to peace, and to 
			the success of the Palestinian people.The Saudi government 
			is taking first steps toward reform, including a plan for gradual 
			introduction of elections. By giving the Saudi people a greater role 
			in their own society, the Saudi government can demonstrate true 
			leadership in the region.The great and proud 
			nation of Egypt has shown the way toward peace in the Middle East, 
			and now should show the way toward democracy in the Middle East. 
			Champions of democracy in the region understand that democracy is 
			not perfect, it is not the path to utopia, but it's the only path to 
			national success and dignity.As we watch and 
			encourage reforms in the region, we are mindful that modernization 
			is not the same as Westernization. Representative governments in the 
			Middle East will reflect their own cultures. They will not, and 
			should not, look like us. Democratic nations may be constitutional 
			monarchies, federal republics, or parliamentary systems. And working 
			democracies always need time to develop -- as did our own. We've 
			taken a 200-year journey toward inclusion and justice -- and this 
			makes us patient and understanding as other nations are at different 
			stages of this journey.There are, however, 
			essential principles common to every successful society, in every 
			culture. Successful societies limit the power of the state and the 
			power of the military -- so that governments respond to the will of 
			the people, and not the will of an elite. Successful societies 
			protect freedom with the consistent and impartial rule of law, 
			instead of selecting applying -- selectively applying the law to 
			punish political opponents. Successful societies allow room for 
			healthy civic institutions -- for political parties and labor unions 
			and independent newspapers and broadcast media. Successful societies 
			guarantee religious liberty -- the right to serve and honor God 
			without fear of persecution. Successful societies privatize their 
			economies, and secure the rights of property. They prohibit and 
			punish official corruption, and invest in the health and education 
			of their people. They recognize the rights of women. And instead of 
			directing hatred and resentment against others, successful societies 
			appeal to the hopes of their own people.These vital principles 
			are being applies in the nations of Afghanistan and Iraq. With the 
			steady leadership of President Karzai, the people of Afghanistan are 
			building a modern and peaceful government. Next month, 500 delegates 
			will convene a national assembly in Kabul to approve a new Afghan 
			constitution. The proposed draft would establish a bicameral 
			parliament, set national elections next year, and recognize 
			Afghanistan's Muslim identity, while protecting the rights of all 
			citizens. Afghanistan faces continuing economic and security 
			challenges -- it will face those challenges as a free and stable 
			democracy.In Iraq, the Coalition 
			Provisional Authority and the Iraqi Governing Council are also 
			working together to build a democracy -- and after three decades of 
			tyranny, this work is not easy. The former dictator ruled by terror 
			and treachery, and left deeply ingrained habits of fear and 
			distrust. Remnants of his regime, joined by foreign terrorists, 
			continue their battle against order and against civilization. Our 
			coalition is responding to recent attacks with precision raids, 
			guided by intelligence provided by the Iraqis, themselves. And we're 
			working closely with Iraqi citizens as they prepare a constitution, 
			as they move toward free elections and take increasing 
			responsibility for their own affairs. As in the defense of Greece in 
			1947, and later in the Berlin Airlift, the strength and will of free 
			peoples are now being tested before a watching world. And we will 
			meet this test.Securing democracy in 
			Iraq is the work of many hands. American and coalition forces are 
			sacrificing for the peace of Iraq and for the security of free 
			nations. Aid workers from many countries are facing danger to help 
			the Iraqi people. The National Endowment for Democracy is promoting 
			women's rights, and training Iraqi journalists, and teaching the 
			skills of political participation. Iraqis, themselves -- police and 
			borders guards and local officials -- are joining in the work and 
			they are sharing in the sacrifice.This is a massive and 
			difficult undertaking -- it is worth our effort, it is worth our 
			sacrifice, because we know the stakes. The failure of Iraqi 
			democracy would embolden terrorists around the world, increase 
			dangers to the American people, and extinguish the hopes of millions 
			in the region. Iraqi democracy will succeed -- and that success will 
			send forth the news, from Damascus to Teheran -- that freedom can be 
			the future of every nation. The establishment of a free Iraq at the 
			heart of the Middle East will be a watershed event in the global 
			democratic revolution.Sixty years of Western 
			nations excusing and accommodating the lack of freedom in the Middle 
			East did nothing to make us safe -- because in the long run, 
			stability cannot be purchased at the expense of liberty. As long as 
			the Middle East remains a place where freedom does not flourish, it 
			will remain a place of stagnation, resentment, and violence ready 
			for export. And with the spread of weapons that can bring 
			catastrophic harm to our country and to our friends, it would be 
			reckless to accept the status quo.Therefore, the United 
			States has adopted a new policy, a forward strategy of freedom in 
			the Middle East. This strategy requires the same persistence and 
			energy and idealism we have shown before. And it will yield the same 
			results. As in Europe, as in Asia, as in every region of the world, 
			the advance of freedom leads to peace.The advance of freedom 
			is the calling of our time; it is the calling of our country. From 
			the Fourteen Points to the Four Freedoms, to the Speech at 
			Westminster, America has put our power at the service of principle. 
			We believe that liberty is the design of nature; we believe that 
			liberty is the direction of history. We believe that human 
			fulfillment and excellence come in the responsible exercise of 
			liberty. And we believe that freedom -- the freedom we prize -- is 
			not for us alone, it is the right and the capacity of all mankind.Working for the spread 
			of freedom can be hard. Yet, America has accomplished hard tasks 
			before. Our nation is strong; we're strong of heart. And we're not 
			alone. Freedom is finding allies in every country; freedom finds 
			allies in every culture. And as we meet the terror and violence of 
			the world, we can be certain the author of freedom is not 
			indifferent to the fate of freedom.With all the tests and 
			all the challenges of our age, this is, above all, the age of 
			liberty. Each of you at this Endowment is fully engaged in the great 
			cause of liberty. And I thank you.May God bless your work. And may 
			God continue to bless America.",thank much please seat thank warm welcome thank invite join anniversary national endowment democracy staff director organization see lot history last two decade part

for pdf[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from
audio.]Thank you very much.Secretary Straw and Secretary Hoon; Admiral Cobbald and Dr. Chipman; 
distinguished guests: I want to thank you for your very kind welcome that you've 
given to me and to Laura. I also thank the groups hosting this event -- The 
Royal United Services Institute, and the International Institute for Strategic 
Studies. We're honored to be in the United Kingdom, and we bring the good wishes 
of the American people.It was pointed out to me that thelast noted Americanto visit London stayed 
in a glass box dangling over the Thames. A few might have been happy to provide 
similar arrangements for me. I thank Her Majesty the Queen for interceding. 
We're honored to be staying at her house.Americans traveling to England always observe more similarities to our 
country than differences. I've been here only a short time, but I've noticed 
that the tradition of free speech -- exercised with enthusiasm -- is alive and 
well here in London. We have that at home, too. They now have that right in 
Baghdad, as well.The people of Great Britain also might see some familiar traits in Americans. 
We're sometimes faulted for a naive faith that liberty can change the world. If 
that's an error it began with reading too much John Locke and Adam Smith. 
Americans have, on occasion, been called moralists who often speak in terms of 
right and wrong. That zeal has been inspired by examples on this island, by the 
tireless compassion of Lord Shaftesbury, the righteous courage of Wilberforce, 
and the firm determination of the Royal Navy over the decades to fight and end 
the trade in slaves.It's rightly said that Americans are a religious people. That's, in part, 
because of the ""Good News"" was translated by 
Tyndale, preached by Wesley, lived out in the example of William Booth. At 
times, Americans are even said to have a puritan streak. And where might that 
have come from? Well, we can start with the Puritans.To this fine heritage, Americans have added a few traits of our own: the good 
influence of our immigrants, the spirit of the frontier. Yet, there remains a 
bit of England in every American. So much of our national character comes from 
you, and we're glad for it.The fellowship of generations is the cause of common beliefs. We believe in 
open societies ordered by moral conviction. We believe in private markets, 
humanized by compassionate government. We believe in economies that reward 
effort, communities that protect the weak, and the duty of nations to respect 
the dignity and the rights of all. And whether one learns these ideals in County 
Durham or in West Texas, they instill mutual respect and they inspire common 
purpose. More than an alliance of security and commerce, the British and 
American peoples have an alliance of values. And, today, this old and tested 
alliance is very strong.The deepest beliefs of our nations set the direction of our foreign policy. 
We value our own civil rights, so we stand for the human rights of others. We 
affirm the God-given dignity of every person, so we are moved to action by 
poverty and oppression and famine and disease. The United States and Great 
Britain share a mission in the world beyond the balance of power or the simple 
pursuit of interest. We seek the advance of freedom and the peace that freedom 
brings. Together our nations are standing and sacrificing for this high goal in 
a distant land at this very hour. And America honors the idealism and the 
bravery of the sons and daughters of Britain.The last President to stay at Buckingham Palace was an idealist, without 
question. At a dinner hosted by King George V, in 1918, Woodrow Wilson made a 
pledge; with typical American understatement, he vowed that right and justice 
would become the predominant and controlling force in the world.President Wilson had come to Europe with his14 Points for Peace. Many complimented 
him on his vision; yet some were dubious. Take, for example, the Prime Minister 
of France. He complained that God, himself, had only 10 commandments. Sounds 
familiar.At Wilson's high point of idealism, however, Europe was one short generation 
from Munich and Auschwitz and the Blitz. Looking back, we see the reasons why. 
The League of Nations, lacking both credibility and will, collapsed at the first 
challenge of the dictators. Free nations failed to recognize, much less 
confront, the aggressive evil in plain sight. And so, dictators went about their 
business, feeding resentments and anti-Semitism, bringing death to innocent 
people in this city and across the world, and filling the last century with 
violence and genocide.Through world war and cold war, we learned that idealism, if it is to do any 
good in this world, requires common purpose and national strength, moral courage 
and patience in difficult tasks. And now our generation has need of these 
qualities.On September the 11th, 2001, terrorists left their mark of murder on my 
country, and took the lives of 67 British citizens. With the passing of months 
and years, it is the natural human desire to resume a quiet life and to put that 
day behind us, as if waking from a dark dream. The hope that danger has passed 
is comforting, is understanding, and it is false. The attacks that followed -- 
on Bali, Jakarta, Casablanca, Bombay, Mombassa, Najaf, Jerusalem, Riyadh, 
Baghdad, and Istanbul -- were not dreams. They're part of a global campaign by 
terrorist networks to intimidate and demoralize all who oppose them.These terrorists target the innocent, and they kill by the thousands. And 
they would, if they gain the weapons they seek, kill by the millions and not be 
finished. The greatest threat of our age is nuclear, chemical, or biological 
weapons in the hands of terrorists, and the dictators who aid them. The evil is 
in plain sight. The danger only increases with denial. Great responsibilities 
fall once again to the great democracies. We will face these threats with open 
eyes, and we will defeat them.The peace and security of free nations now rests on three pillars: First, 
international organizations must be equal to the challenges facing our world, 
from lifting up failing states to opposing proliferation.Like 11 Presidents before me, I believe in the international institutions and 
alliances that America helped to form and helps to lead. The United States and 
Great Britain have labored hard to help make the United Nations what it is 
supposed to be -- an effective instrument of our collective security. In recent 
months, we've sought and gained three additional resolutions on Iraq -- 
Resolutions 1441, 1483, and 1511 -- precisely because the global danger of 
terror demands a global response. The United Nations has no more compelling 
advocate than your Prime Minister, who at every turn has championed its ideals 
and appealed to its authority. He understands, as well, that the credibility of 
the U.N. depends on a willingness to keep its word and to act when action is 
required.America and Great Britain have done, and will do, all in their power to 
prevent the United Nations from solemnly choosing its own irrelevance and 
inviting the fate of the League of Nations. It's not enough to meet the dangers 
of the world with resolutions; we must meet those dangers with resolve.In this century, as in the last, nations can accomplish more together than 
apart. For 54 years, America has stood with our partners in NATO, the most 
effective multilateral institution in history. We're committed to this great 
democratic alliance, and we believe it must have the will and the capacity to 
act beyond Europe where threats emerge.My nation welcomes the growing unity of Europe, and the world needs America 
and the European Union to work in common purpose for the advance of security and 
justice. America is cooperating with four other nations to meet the dangers 
posed by North Korea. America believes the IAEA must be true to its purpose and 
hold Iran to its obligations.Our first choice, and our constant practice, is to work with other 
responsible governments. We understand, as well, that the success of 
multilateralism is not measured by adherence to forms alone -- the tidiness of 
the process -- but by the results we achieve to keep our nations secure.The second pillar of peace and security in our world is the willingness of 
free nations, when the last resort arrives, to retain*  
[sic] aggression and evil by force. There are principled objections to 
the use of force in every generation, and I credit the good motives behind these 
views.Those in authority, however, are not judged only by good motivations. The 
people have given us the duty to defend them. And that duty sometimes requires 
the violent restraint of violent men. In some cases, the measured use of force 
is all that protects us from a chaotic world ruled by force.Most in the peaceful West have no living memory of that kind of world. Yet in 
some countries, the memories are recent: The victims of ethnic cleansing in the 
Balkans, those who survived the rapists and the death squads, have few qualms 
when NATO applied force to help end those crimes. The women of Afghanistan, 
imprisoned in their homes and beaten in the streets and executed in public 
spectacles, did not reproach us for routing the Taliban. The inhabitants of 
Iraq's Baathist hell, with its lavish palaces and its torture chambers, with its 
massive statutes** [sic] and its mass graves, do 
not miss their fugitive dictator. They rejoiced at his fall.In all these cases, military action was proceeded by diplomatic initiatives 
and negotiations and ultimatums, and final chances until the final moment. In 
Iraq, year after year, the dictator was given the chance to account for his 
weapons programs, and end the nightmare for his people. Now, the resolutions he 
defied have been enforced.And who will say that Iraq was better off when Saddam Hussein was strutting 
and killing, or that the world was safer when he held power? Who doubts that 
Afghanistan is a more just society and less dangerous without Mullah Omar 
playing host to terrorists from around the world. And Europe, too, is plainly 
better off with Milosevic answering for his crimes, instead of committing more.It's been said that those who live near a police station find it hard to 
believe in the triumph of violence. In the same way free peoples might be 
tempted to take for granted the orderly societies we have come to know. Europe's 
peaceful unity is one of the great achievements of the last half-century. And 
because European countries now resolve differences through negotiation and 
consensus, there's sometimes an assumption that the entire world functions in 
the same way. But let us never forget how Europe's unity was achieved -- by 
allied armies of liberation and NATO armies of defense. And let us never forget, 
beyond Europe's borders, in a world where oppression and violence are very real, 
liberation is still a moral goal, and freedom and security still need defenders.The third pillar of security is our commitment to the global expansion of 
democracy, and the hope and progress it brings, as the alternative to 
instability and hatred and terror. We cannot rely exclusively on military power 
to assure our long-term security. Lasting peace is gained as justice and 
democracy advance.In democratic and successful societies, men and women do not swear allegiance 
to malcontents and murderers; they turn their hearts and labor to building 
better lives. And democratic governments do not shelter terrorist camps or 
attack their peaceful neighbors; they honor the aspirations and dignity of their 
own people. In our conflict with terror and tyranny, we have an unmatched 
advantage, a power that cannot be resisted, and that is the appeal of freedom to 
all mankind.As global powers, both our nations serve the cause of freedom in many ways, 
in many places. By promoting development, and fighting famine and AIDS and other 
diseases, we're fulfilling our moral duties, as well as encouraging stability 
and building a firmer basis for democratic institutions. By working for justice 
in Burma, in the Sudan and in Zimbabwe, we give hope to suffering people and 
improve the chances for stability and progress. By extending the reach of trade 
we foster prosperity and the habits of liberty. And by advancing freedom in the 
greater Middle East, we help end a cycle of dictatorship and radicalism that 
brings millions to [sic] people to misery and 
brings danger to our own people.The stakes in that region could not be higher. If the Middle East remains a 
place where freedom does not flourish, it will remain a place of stagnation and 
anger and violence for export. And as we saw in the ruins of two towers, no 
distance on the map will protect our lives and way of life. If the greater 
Middle East joins the democratic revolution that has reached much of the world, 
the lives of millions in that region will be bettered, and a trend of conflict 
and fear will be ended at its source.The movement of history will not come about quickly. Because of our own 
democratic development -- the fact that it was gradual and, at times, turbulent 
-- we must be patient with others. And the Middle East countries have some 
distance to travel.Arab scholars speak of a freedom deficit that has separated whole nations 
from the progress of our time. The essentials of social and material progress -- 
limited government, equal justice under law, religious and economic liberty, 
political participation, free press, and respect for the rights of women -- have 
been scarce across the region. Yet that has begun to change. In an arc of reform 
from Morocco to Jordan to Qatar, we are seeing elections and new protections for 
women and the stirring of political pluralism. Many governments are realizing 
that theocracy and dictatorship do not lead to national greatness; they end in 
national ruin. They are finding, as others will find, that national progress and 
dignity are achieved when governments are just and people are free.The democratic progress we've seen in the Middle East was not imposed from 
abroad, and neither will the greater progress we hope to see. Freedom, by 
definition, must be chosen, and defended by those who choose it. Our part, as 
free nations, is to ally ourselves with reform, wherever it occurs.Perhaps the most helpful change we can make is to change in our own thinking. 
In the West, there's been a certain skepticism about the capacity or even the 
desire of Middle Eastern peoples for self-government. We're told that Islam is 
somehow inconsistent with a democratic culture. Yet more than half of the 
world's Muslims are today contributing citizens in democratic societies. It is 
suggested that the poor, in their daily struggles, care little for 
self-government. Yet the poor, especially, need the power of democracy to defend 
themselves against corrupt elites.Peoples of the Middle East share a high civilization, a religion of personal 
responsibility, and a need for freedom as deep as our own. It is not realism to 
suppose that one-fifth of humanity is unsuited to liberty; it is pessimism and 
condescension, and we should have none of it.We must shake off decades of failed policy in the Middle East. Your nation 
and mine, in the past, have been willing to make a bargain, to tolerate 
oppression for the sake of stability. Longstanding ties often led us to overlook 
the faults of local elites. Yet this bargain did not bring stability or make us 
safe. It merely bought time, while problems festered and ideologies of violence 
took hold.As recent history has shown, we cannot turn a blind eye to oppression just 
because the oppression is not in our own backyard. No longer should we think 
tyranny is benign because it is temporarily convenient. Tyranny is never benign 
to its victims, and our great democracies should oppose tyranny wherever it is 
found.Now we're pursuing a different course, a forward strategy of freedom in the 
Middle East. We will consistently challenge the enemies of reform and confront 
the allies of terror. We will expect a higher standard from our friends in the 
region, and we will meet our responsibilities in Afghanistan and in Iraq by 
finishing the work of democracy we have begun.There were good-faith disagreements in your country and mine over the course 
and timing of military action in Iraq. Whatever has come before, we now have 
only two options: to keep our word, or to break our word. The failure of 
democracy in Iraq would throw its people back into misery and turn that country 
over to terrorists who wish to destroy us. Yet democracy will succeed in Iraq, 
because our will is firm, our word is good, and the Iraqi people will not 
surrender their freedom.Since the liberation of Iraq, we have seen changes that could hardly have 
been imagined a year ago. A new Iraqi police force protects the people, instead 
of bullying them. More than 150 Iraqi newspapers are now in circulation, 
printing what they choose, not what they're ordered. Schools are open, with 
textbooks free of propaganda. Hospitals are functioning and are well-supplied. 
Iraq has a new currency, the first battalion of a new army, representative local 
governments, and a Governing Council with an aggressive timetable for national 
sovereignty. This is substantial progress. And much of it has proceeded faster 
than similar efforts in Germany and Japan after World War II.Yet the violence we are seeing in Iraq today is serious. And it comes from 
Baathist holdouts and Jihadists from other countries, and terrorists drawn to 
the prospect of innocent bloodshed. It is the nature of terrorism and the 
cruelty of a few to try to bring grief in the loss to many. The armed forces of 
both our countries have taken losses, felt deeply by our citizens. Some families 
now live with a burden of great sorrow. We cannot take the pain away. But these 
families can know they are not alone. We pray for their strength; we pray for 
their comfort; and we will never forget the courage of the ones they loved.The terrorists have a purpose, a strategy to their cruelty. They view the 
rise of democracy in Iraq as a powerful threat to their ambitions. In this, they 
are correct. They believe their acts of terror against our coalition, against 
international aid workers and against innocent Iraqis, will make us recoil and 
retreat. In this, they are mistaken.We did not charge hundreds of miles into the heart of Iraq and pay a bitter 
cost of casualties, and liberate 25 million people, only to retreat before a 
band of thugs and assassins. We will help the Iraqi people establish a peaceful 
and democratic country in the heart of the Middle East. And by doing so, we will 
defend our people from danger.The forward strategy of freedom must also apply to the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
It's a difficult period in a part of the world that has known many. Yet, our 
commitment remains firm. We seek justice and dignity. We seek a viable, 
independent state for the Palestinian people, who have been betrayed by others 
for too long. We seek security and recognition for the state of Israel, which 
has lived in the shadow of random death for too long. These are worthy goals in 
themselves, and by reaching them we will also remove an occasion and excuse for 
hatred and violence in the broader Middle East.Achieving peace in the Holy Land is not just a matter of the shape of a 
border. As we work on the details of peace, we must look to the heart of the 
matter, which is the need for a viable Palestinian democracy. Peace will not be 
achieved by Palestinian rulers who intimidate opposition, who tolerate and 
profit from corruption and maintain their ties to terrorist groups. These are 
the methods of the old elites, who time and again had put their own 
self-interest above the interest of the people they claim to serve. The 
long-suffering Palestinian people deserve better. They deserve true leaders, 
capable of creating and governing a Palestinian state.Even after the setbacks and frustrations of recent months, goodwill and hard 
effort can bring about a Palestinian state and a secure Israel. Those who would 
lead a new Palestine should adopt peaceful means to achieve the rights of their 
people and create the reformed institutions of a stable democracy.Israel should freeze settlement construction, dismantle unauthorized 
outposts, end the daily humiliation of the Palestinian people, and not prejudice 
final negotiations with the placements of walls and fences.Arab states should end incitement in their own media, cut off public and 
private funding for terrorism, and establish normal relations with Israel.Leaders in Europe should withdraw all favor and support from any Palestinian 
ruler who fails his people and betrays their cause. And Europe's leaders -- and 
all leaders -- should strongly oppose anti-Semitism, which poisons public 
debates over the future of the Middle East.***Ladies and gentlemen, we have great objectives before us that make our*** 
Atlantic alliance as vital as it has ever been. We will encourage the strength 
and effectiveness of international institutions. We will use force when 
necessary in the defense of freedom. And we will raise up an ideal of democracy 
in every part of the world.On these three pillars we will build the peace and security of all free 
nations in a time of danger.So much good has come from our alliance of conviction and might. So much now 
depends on the strength of this alliance as we go forward. America has always 
found strong partners in London, leaders of good judgment and blunt counsel and 
backbone when times are tough. And I have found all those qualities in your 
current Prime Minister, who has my respect and my deepest thanks.The ties between our nations, however, are deeper than the relationship 
between leaders. These ties endure because they are formed by the experience and 
responsibilities and adversity we have shared. And in the memory of our peoples, 
there will always be one experience, one central event, when the seal was fixed 
on the friendship between Britain and the United States: The arrival in Great 
Britain of more than 1.5 million American soldiers and airmen in the 1940s was a 
turning point in the second world war. For many Britons, it was a first close 
look at Americans, other than in the movies. Some of you here today may still 
remember the ""friendly invasion."" Our lads, they took some getting used to. 
There was even a saying about what many of them were up to -- in addition to being 
""overpaid and over here.""At a reunion in North London some years ago, an American pilot who had 
settled in England after his military service, said, ""Well, I'm still over here, 
and probably overpaid. So two out of three isn't bad.""In that time of war, the English people did get used to the Americans. They 
welcomed soldiers and fliers into their villages and homes, and took to calling 
them, ""our boys."" About 70,000 of those boys did their part to affirm our 
special relationship. They returned home with English brides.Americans gained a certain image of Britain, as well. We saw an island 
threatened on every side, a leader who did not waver, and a country of the 
firmest character. And that has not changed. The British people are the sort of 
partners you want when serious work needs doin'. The men and women of this 
Kingdom are kind and steadfast and generous and brave. And America is fortunate 
to call this country our closest friend in the world.May God bless you all.",peace security whitehall palace palace address iraq policydelivered november whitehall palace london englandaudio

41,24 April 2004,>George W. Bush - Remarks on Medicare Legislation Signi,"icare Legislation SigningGeorgeW.BushMedicare 
Legislation Signing Remarksdelivered 8 
December 2003, White House, Washington, D.C.Audio mp3 of AddressYour browser does not support the audio element.Thank you, all.
		Good morning, thanks for the warm welcome. In a few moments I will have 
		the honor of signing an historic act of Congress into law. I'm pleased 
		that all of you are here to witness the greatest advance in health care 
		coverage for America's seniors since the founding of Medicare.With theMedicare Act of 2003, our government is 
		finally bringing prescription drug coverage to the seniors of America. 
		With this law, we're giving older Americans better choices and more 
		control over their health care, so they can receive the modern medical 
		care they deserve. With this law, we are providing more access to 
		comprehensive exams, disease screenings, and other preventative care, so 
		that seniors across this land can live better and healthier lives. With 
		this law, we are creating Health Savings Accounts -- we do so, so that 
		all Americans can put money away for their health care tax-free.Our nation has the best health care system in the world. And we want our 
		seniors to share in the benefits of that system. Our nation has made a 
		promise, a solemn promise to America's seniors. We have pledged to help 
		our citizens find affordable medical care in the later years of life. 
		Lyndon Johnson established that commitment by signing theMedicare Act of 1965. And today, by 
		reforming and modernizing this vital program, we are honoring the 
		commitments of Medicare to all our seniors.The point man in my administration on this issue was Secretary Tommy 
		Thompson, and he and his team did a fabulous job of working with the 
		Congress to get this important piece of legislation passed. Tommy, I 
		want to thank you for your leadership.This bill passed the Congress because of the strong leadership of a 
		handful of members, starting with the Speaker of the House Denny 
		Hastert. Mr. Speaker -- Mr. Speaker was joined by Senator Bill Frist, 
		the Senate Majority Leader of the Senate, in providing the leadership 
		necessary to get this bill done. I want to thank you both.I appreciate the hard work of the House Majority Leader, Tom DeLay, in 
		seeing that this bill was passed. I also appreciate the hard work of the 
		Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Chairman Bill Thomas, for his 
		good work. The Chairman of the Finance Committee in the Senate, Senator 
		Chuck Grassley, did a noble job. And he was joined in this task by the 
		Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, Senator Max Baucus of Montana.And the entire Senate effort was boosted by the efforts of a man from 
		Louisiana, Senator John Breaux. And speaking about Louisiana, Billy 
		Tauzin of the House of Representatives did great work on this bill. 
		Senator Orrin Hatch from Utah made a significant contribution. Nancy 
		Johnson, the House member from Connecticut, did a great job. Mike 
		Bilirakis from Florida worked hard on this piece of legislation. I want 
		to thank all the other members of the Congress and the Senate who have 
		joined us. Thank you all for taking time out of your busy schedules to 
		share in this historic moment.I appreciate Tom Scully, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare 
		and Medicaid Services, for his good work. The Director of the CDC, Julie 
		Gerberding, is with us today. Julie, thank you for coming. The Food and 
		Drug Administration Commissioner Mark McClellan is here. Jo Anne 
		Barnhart, the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, is 
		with us. Thank you for coming, Jo Anne. Kay James who is the Director of 
		the Office of Personnel Management, is with us. Thank you for coming, 
		Kay.A lot of this happened -- this bill happened because of grassroots work. 
		A lot of our fellow citizens took it upon themselves to agitate for 
		change, to lobby on behalf of what's right. We had some governor support 
		around the country -- Governor Craig Benson from New Hampshire is with 
		us today. Governor, thank you for coming.But the groups that speak for the elderly did fantastic work on this 
		legislation. See, there was a lot of pressure not to get something done 
		-- for the wrong reasons, I might add. But Bill Novelli, the CEO of 
		AARP, stood strong in representing the people he was supposed to 
		represent and he worked hard to get this legislation passed. And, Bill, 
		I want to thank you for your leadership. You were joined by Jim Parkel, 
		who is the President of the AARP. Jim, I want to thank you, as well, for 
		doing what was right, for focusing on the needs of the seniors of our 
		country.Jim Martin, the President of 60 Plus Association, worked hard. Charlie 
		Jarvis, the Chairman and CEO of United Seniors Association, worked hard. 
		Mike Maves, the Executive Vice President and CEO of the AMA, worked hard 
		on this piece of legislation. Mary Martin, the Chairman of the Board of 
		The Seniors Coalition, worked hard. The truth of the matter is, a lot of 
		good people worked hard to get this important legislation done, and I 
		thank you for your work.Medicare is a great achievement of a compassionate government and it is 
		a basic trust we honor. Medicare has spared millions of seniors from 
		needless hardship. Each generation benefits from Medicare. Each 
		generation has a duty to strengthen Medicare. And this generation is 
		fulfilling our duty.First and foremost, this new law will provide Medicare coverage for 
		prescription drugs. Medicare was enacted to provide seniors with the 
		latest in modern medicine. In 1965, that usually meant house calls, or 
		operations, or long hospital stays. Today, modern medicine includes 
		out-patient care, disease screenings, and prescription drugs.Medicine has changed, but Medicare has not -- until today. Medicare 
		today will pay for extended hospital stays for ulcer surgery. That's at 
		a cost of about $28,000 per patient. Yet Medicare will not pay for the 
		drugs that eliminate the cause of most ulcers, drugs that cost about 
		$500 a year. It's a good thing that Medicare pays when seniors get sick. 
		Now, you see, we're taking this a step further -- Medicare will pay for 
		prescription drugs, so that fewer seniors will get sick in the first 
		place.Drug coverage under Medicare will allow seniors to replace more 
		expensive surgeries and hospitalizations with less expensive 
		prescription medicine. And even more important, drug coverage under 
		Medicare will save our seniors from a lot of worry. Some older Americans 
		spend much of their Social Security checks just on their medications. 
		Some cut down on the dosage, to make a bottle of pills last longer. 
		Elderly Americans should not have to live with those kinds of fears and 
		hard choices. This new law will ease the burden on seniors and will give 
		them the extra help they need.Seniors will start seeing help quickly. During the transition to the 
		full prescription benefit, seniors will receive a drug discount card. 
		This Medicare-approved card will deliver savings of 10 to 25 percent off 
		the retail price of most medicines. Low-income seniors will receive the 
		same savings, plus a $600 credit on their cards to help them pay for the 
		medications they need.In about two years, full prescription coverage under Medicare will 
		begin. In return for a monthly premium of about $35, most seniors 
		without any prescription drug coverage can now expect to see their 
		current drug bills cut roughly in half. This new law will provide 95 
		percent coverage for out-of-pocket drug spending that exceeds $3,600 a 
		year. For the first time, we're giving seniors peace of mind that they 
		will not have to face unlimited expenses for their medicine.The new law offers special help to one-third of older Americans will low 
		incomes, such as a senior couple with low savings and an annual income 
		of about $18,000 or less. These seniors will pay little or no premium 
		for full drug coverage. Their deductible will be no higher than $50 per 
		year, and their co-payment on each prescription will be as little as $1. 
		Seniors in the greatest need will have the greatest help under the 
		modernized Medicare system.I visited with seniors around the country and heard many of their 
		stories. I'm proud that this legislation will give them practical and 
		much needed help. Mary Jane Jones from Midlothian, Virginia, has a 
		modest income. Her drug bills total nearly $500 a month. Things got so 
		tight for a while she had to use needles twice or three times for her 
		insulin shots. With this law, Mary Jane won't have to go to such 
		extremes. In exchange for a monthly premium of about $35, Mary Jane 
		Jones would save nearly $2,700 in annual prescription drug spending.Hugh Iverson from West Des Moines, Iowa, just got his Medicare 
		membership. And that's a good thing, because he hasn't had health 
		insurance for more than three years. His drug bills total at least $400 
		a month. Within two years, with the $35 a month coverage, he will be 
		able to cut those bills nearly in half, saving him about $2,400 a year.Neil LeGrow from Culpepper, Virginia, takes 15 medications, costing him 
		at least $700 a month. To afford all those medications, Neil has to stay 
		working. And thanks to this law, once he is enrolled in the drug 
		benefit, he will be able to cut back his work hours and enjoy his 
		retirement more because he'll have coverage that saves him about $4,700 
		a year.I promised these seniors when I met with them that we would work hard to 
		give them the help they need. They are all here today. So I am happy to 
		report to them in person -- Mary Jane, Hugh, and Neil, we are keeping 
		our promise.In addition to providing coverage for prescription drugs, this 
		legislation achieves a second great goal. We're giving our seniors more 
		health care choices so they can get the coverage and care that meets 
		their needs. Every senior needs to know if you don't want to change your 
		current coverage, you don't have to change. You're the one in charge. If 
		you want to keep your Medicare the way it is, along with the new 
		prescription benefit, that is your right. If you want to improve 
		benefits -- maybe dental coverage, or eyeglass coverage, or managed care 
		plans that reduce out-of-pocket costs -- you'll be free to make those 
		choices, as well.And when seniors have the ability to make choices, health care plans 
		within Medicare will have to compete for their business by offering 
		higher quality service. For the seniors of America, more choices and 
		more control will mean better health care. These are the kinds of health 
		care options we give to the members of Congress and federal employees. 
		They have the ability to pick plans to -- that are right for their own 
		needs. What's good for members of Congress is also good for seniors. Our 
		seniors are fully capable of making health care choices, and this bill 
		allows them to do just that.A third purpose achieved by this legislation is smarter medicine within 
		the Medicare system. For years, our seniors have been denied Medicare 
		coverage -- have been denied Medicare coverage for a basic physical 
		exam. Beginning in 2005, all newly-enrolled Medicare beneficiaries will 
		be covered for a complete physical.The Medicare system will now help seniors and their doctors diagnose 
		health problems early, so they can treat them early and our seniors can 
		have a better quality life. For example, starting next year, all people 
		on Medicare will be covered for blood tests that can diagnose heart 
		diseases. Those at high risk for diabetes will be covered for blood 
		sugar screening tests. Modern health care is not complete without 
		prevention -- so we are expanding preventive services under Medicare.Fourth, the new law will help all Americans pay for out-of-pocket health 
		costs. This legislation will create health savings accounts, effective 
		January 1, 2004, so Americans can set aside up to $4,500 every year, tax 
		free, to save for medical expenses. Depending on your tax bracket, that 
		means you'll save between 10 to 35 percent on any costs covered by money 
		in your account. Our laws encourage people to plan for retirement and to 
		save for education. Now the law will make it easier for Americans to 
		save for their future health care, as well.A health savings account is a good deal, and all Americans should 
		consider it. Every year, the money not spent would stay in the account 
		and gain interest tax-free, just like an IRA. And people will have an 
		incentive to live more healthy lifestyles because they want to see their 
		health savings account grow. These accounts will be good for small 
		business owners, and employees. More businesses can focus on covering 
		workers for major medical problems, such as hospitalization for an 
		injury or illness. And at the same time, employees and their families 
		will use these accounts to cover doctors visits or lab tests or other 
		smaller costs. Some employers will contribute to employee health 
		accounts. This will help more American families get the health care they 
		need at the price they can afford.The legislation I'm about to sign will set in motion a series of 
		improvements in the care available to all America's senior citizens. And 
		as we begin, it is important for seniors and those approaching 
		retirement to understand their new benefits.This coming spring, seniors will receive a letter to explain the drug 
		discount card. In June, these cards, including the $600 annual drug 
		credit for low-income seniors, will be activated. This drug card can be 
		used until the end of 2005. In the fall of that year, seniors will 
		receive an information booklet giving simple guidance on changes in the 
		program and the new choices they will have. Then in January of 2006, 
		seniors will have their new coverage, including permanent coverage for 
		prescription drugs.These reforms are the act of a vibrant and compassionate government. We 
		show are concern for the dignity of our seniors by giving them quality 
		health care. We show our respect for seniors by giving them more choices 
		and more control over their decision-making. We're putting individuals 
		in charge of their health care decisions. And as we move to modernize 
		and reform other programs of this government, we will always trust 
		individuals and their decisions, and put personal choice at the heart of 
		our efforts.The challenges facing seniors on Medicare were apparent for many years. 
		And those years passed with much debate and a lot of politics, and 
		little reform to show for it. And that changed with the 108th Congress. 
		This year we met our challenge with focus and perseverance. We 
		confronted problems, instead of passing them along to future 
		administrations and future Congresses. We overcame old partisan 
		differences. We kept our promise, and found a way to get the job done. 
		This legislation is the achievement of members in both political 
		parties. And this legislation is a victory for all of America's seniors.Now I'm honored and pleased to sign this historic piece of legislation:

audio.]Good afternoon. Yesterday, December the 13th, at around 8:30 p.m. Baghdad 
time, United States military forces captured Saddam Hussein alive. He was found 
near a farmhouse outside the city of Tikrit, in a swift raid conducted without 
casualties. And now the former dictator of Iraq will face the justice he denied 
to millions.The capture of this man was crucial to the rise of a free Iraq. It marks the 
end of the road for him, and for all who bullied and killed in his name. For the 
Baathist holdouts largely responsible for the current violence, there will be no 
return to the corrupt power and privilege they once held. For the vast majority 
of Iraqi citizens who wish to live as free men and women, this event brings 
further assurance that the torture chambers and the secret police are gone 
forever.And this afternoon, I have a message for the Iraqi people: You will not have 
to fear the rule of Saddam Hussein ever again. All Iraqis who take the side of 
freedom have taken the winning side. The goals of our coalition are the same as 
your goals -- sovereignty for your country, dignity for your great culture, and 
for every Iraqi citizen, the opportunity for a better life.In the history of Iraq, a dark and painful era is over. A hopeful day has 
arrived. All Iraqis can now come together and reject violence and build a new 
Iraq.The success of yesterday's mission is a tribute to our men and women now 
serving in Iraq. The operation was based on the superb work of intelligence 
analysts who found the dictator's footprints in a vast country. The operation 
was carried out with skill and precision by a brave fighting force. Our 
servicemen and women and our coalition allies have faced many dangers in the 
hunt for members of the fallen regime, and in their effort to bring hope and 
freedom to the Iraqi people. Their work continues, and so do the risks. Today, 
on behalf of the nation, I thank the members of our Armed Forces and I 
congratulate 'em.I also have a message for all Americans: The capture of Saddam Hussein does 
not mean the end of violence in Iraq. We still face terrorists who would rather 
go on killing the innocent than accept the rise of liberty in the heart of the 
Middle East. Such men are a direct threat to the American people, and they will 
be defeated.We've come to this moment through patience and resolve and focused action. 
And that is our strategy moving forward. The war on terror is a different kind 
of war, waged capture by capture, cell by cell, and victory by victory. Our 
security is assured by our perseverance and by our sure belief in the success of 
liberty. And the United States of America will not relent until this war is won.May God bless the people of Iraq, and may God bless America.Thank you.",eorge bush announce capture saddam capture saddam husseindelivered december cabinet roomaudio require flash audioyour browser support audio pdfclick flash authenticity certify text version transcribe directly audio good afternoon yesterday december around baghdad time unite state military force capture saddam hussein alive find near farmhouse outside city tikrit swift raid conduct without casualty former dictator iraq face justice deny capture man crucial rise free iraq mark end road bully kill name baathist holdout largely responsible current violence return corrupt power privilege hold vast majority iraqi citizen wish live free men woman event bring assurance torture chamber secret police go afternoon message iraqi people fear rule saddam hussein ever iraqi take side freedom take win side goal coalition goal sovereignty country dignity great culture every iraqi citizen opportunity better history iraq dark painful era hopeful day arrive iraqi come together reject violence build new success yesterday mission tribute men woman serve iraq operation base superb work intelligence analyst find dictator footprint vast country operation carry skill precision brave fight force serviceman woman coalition ally face many danger hunt member fall regime effort bring hope freedom iraqi people work continue risk today behalf nation thank member arm force congratulate also message american capture saddam hussein mean end violence iraq still face terrorist would rather go kill innocent accept rise liberty heart middle east men direct threat american people come moment patience resolve focus action strategy move forward war terror different kind war wag capture capture cell cell victory victory security assure perseverance sure belief success liberty unite state america relent war god bless people iraq may god bless,eorge bush announce capture capture saddam cabinet roomaudio audioyour support audio pdfclick flash authenticity version transcribe afternoon yesterday time state force capture saddam hussein find farmhouse city tikrit swift conduct casualty dictator iraq face justice capture man rise iraq mark end road baathist holdout violence return power privilege majority men woman event assurance torture chamber police afternoon message people rule saddam hussein side freedom side goal coalition goal sovereignty country dignity culture iraqi opportunity history dark era day iraqi violence success yesterday mission men woman operation base superb work intelligence analyst dictator footprint country operation precision force serviceman woman coalition danger hunt member fall regime effort hope freedom people risk today nation thank member arm force congratulate capture saddam hussein end violence iraq terrorist accept heart men threat people moment patience resolve focus action strategy war terror kind war wag capture capture cell cell victory victory security assure perseverance belief success liberty state relent war god bless people bless

from audio.]Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, 

distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:America this evening is a Nation called to great 

responsibilities. And we are rising to meet them.As we gather tonight, hundreds of thousands of American 

servicemen and women are deployed across the world in the war on terror. By 

bringing hope to the oppressed, and delivering justice to the violent, they are 

making America more secure.Each day, law enforcement personnel and intelligence 

officers are tracking terrorist threats; analysts are examining airline 

passenger lists; the men and women of our new Homeland Security Department are 

patrolling our coasts and borders. And their vigilance is protecting America.Americans are proving once again to be the hardest working 

people in the world. The American economy is growing stronger. The tax relief 

you passed is working.Tonight, Members of Congress can take pride in the great works 

of compassion and reform that skeptics had thought impossible. You're raising 

the standards for our public schools; and you're giving our senior citizens 

prescription drug coverage under Medicare.We have faced serious challenges together, and now we face 

a choice. We can go forward with confidence and resolve, or we can turn back to 

the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are 

no threat to us. We can press on with economic growth, and reforms in education 

and Medicare, or we can turn back to old policies and old divisions.We've not come all this way -- through tragedy, and trial, 

and war -- only to falter and leave our work unfinished. Americans are rising to 

the tasks of history, and they expect the same from us. In their efforts, their 

enterprise, and their character, the American people are showing that the state 

of our Union is confident and strong.Our greatest responsibility is the active defense of the 

American people. Twenty-eight months have passed since September the 11th, 2001 

-- 

over two years without an attack on American soil -- and it is tempting to 

believe that the danger is behind us. That hope is understandable, comforting -- 

and false. The killing has continued in Bali, Jakarta, Casablanca, Riyadh, 

Mombassa, Jerusalem, Istanbul, and Baghdad. The terrorists continue to plot 

against America and the civilized world. And by our will and courage, this 

danger will be defeated.Inside the United States, where the war began, we must 

continue to give our homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they 

need to defend us. And one of those essential tools is thePATRIOT Act, which 

allows Federal law enforcement to better share information, to track terrorists, 

to disrupt their cells, and to seize their assets. For years, we have used 

similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug traffickers. If these methods 

are good for hunting criminals, they are even more important for hunting 

terrorists. Key provisions of the PATRIOT Act are set to expire next year. The 

terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule. Our law enforcement needs 

this vital legislation to protect our citizens. You need to renew the PATRIOT 

Act.America is on the offensive against the terrorists who 

started this war. Last March, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a mastermind of September 

the 11th, awoke to find himself in the custody of U.S. and Pakistani authorities. 

Last August the 11th brought the capture of the terrorist Hambali, who was a key 

player in the attack in Indonesia that killed over 200 people. We're tracking 

al-Qaida around the world, and nearly two-thirds of their known leaders have 

now been captured or killed. Thousands of very skilled and determined military 

personnel are on the manhunt, going after the remaining killers who hide in cities 

and caves, and, one by one, we will bring these terrorists to justice.As part of the offensive against terror, we are also 

confronting the regimes that harbor and support terrorists, and could supply 

them with nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. The United States and our 

allies are determined: We refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate danger.The first to see our determination were the Taliban, who 

made Afghanistan the primary training base of al-Qaida killers. As of this 

month, that country has a new constitution, guaranteeing free elections and full 

participation by women. Businesses are opening, health care centers are being 

established, and the boys and girls of Afghanistan are back in school. With the help 

from the new Afghan Army, our coalition is leading aggressive raids against 

surviving members of the Taliban and al-Qaida. The men and women of Afghanistan 

are building a nation that is free, and proud, and fighting terror -- and America 

is honored to be their friend.Since we last met in this chamber, combat forces of the 

United States, Great Britain, Australia, Poland, and other countries enforced 

the demands of the United Nations, ended the rule of Saddam Hussein, and the 

people of Iraq are free. Having broken the Baathist regime, we face a remnant of 

violent Saddam supporters. Men who ran away from our troops in battle are now 

dispersed and attack from the shadows.These killers, joined by foreign terrorists, are a serious, 

continuing danger. Yet we're making progress against them. The once 

all-powerful ruler of Iraq was found in a hole, and now sits in a prison cell. 

Of the top 55 officials of the former regime, we have captured or killed 45. Our 

forces are on the offensive, leading over 1,600 patrols a day, and conducting an 

average of 180 raids a week. We are dealing with these thugs in Iraq, just 

as surely as we dealt with Saddam Hussein's evil regime.The work of building a new Iraq is hard, and it is right. 

And America has always been willing to do what it takes for what is right. Last 

January, Iraq's only law was the whim of one brutal man. Today our coalition is 

working with the Iraqi Governing Council to draft a basic law, with a bill of 

rights. We're working with Iraqis and the United Nations to prepare for a 

transition to full Iraqi sovereignty by the end of June. As democracy takes hold 

in Iraq, the enemies of freedom will do all in their power to spread violence 

and fear. They are trying to shake the will of our country and our friends, but 

the United States of America will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins. 

The killers will fail, and the Iraqi people will live in freedom.Month by month, Iraqis are assuming more responsibility for 

their own security and their own future. And tonight we are honored to welcome 

one of Iraq's most respected leaders: the current President of the Iraqi 

Governing Council, Adnan Pachachi. Sir, America stands with you and the Iraqi 

people as you build a free and peaceful nation.Because of American leadership and resolve, the world is 

changing for the better. Last month, the leader of Libya voluntarily pledged to 

disclose and dismantle all of his regime's weapons of mass destruction programs, 

including a uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons. Colonel Qadhafi 

correctly judged that his country would be better off, and far more secure, 

without weapons of mass murder. Nine months of intense negotiations involving 

the United States and Great Britain succeeded with Libya, while 12 years of 

diplomacy with Iraq did not. And one reason is clear: For diplomacy to be 

effective, words must be credible -- and no one can now doubt the word of 

America.Different threats require different strategies. Along with 

nations in the region, we are insisting that North Korea eliminate its nuclear 

program. America and the international community are demanding that Iran meet 

its commitments and not develop nuclear weapons. America is committed to keeping 

the world's most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most 

dangerous regimes.When I came to this rostrum on September 20th, 2001, I 

brought the police shield of a fallen officer, my reminder of lives that ended, 

and a task that does not end. I gave to you and to all Americans my complete 

commitment to securing our country and defeating our enemies. And this pledge, 

given by one, has been kept by many. You in the Congress have provided the 

resources for our defense, and cast the difficult votes of war and peace. Our 

closest allies have been unwavering. America's intelligence personnel and 

diplomats have been skilled and tireless.And the men and women of the American military -- they have 

taken the hardest duty. We've seen their skill and their courage in armored charges, 

and midnight raids, and lonely hours on faithful watch. We have seen the joy 

when they return, and felt the sorrow when one is lost. I've had the honor of 

meeting our servicemen and women at many posts, from the deck of a carrier in 

the Pacific, to a mess hall in Baghdad. Many of our troops are listening 

tonight. And I want you and your families to know: America is proud of you. And 

my Administration, and this Congress, will give you the resources you need to 

fight and win the war on terror.I know that some people question if America is really in a 

war at all. They view terrorism more as a crime, a problem to be solved mainly 

with law enforcement and indictments. After the World Trade Center was first 

attacked in 1993, some of the guilty were indicted and tried and convicted, and sent 

to prison. But the matter was not settled. The terrorists were still training 

and plotting in other nations, and drawing up more ambitious plans. After the 

chaos and carnage of September the 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with 

legal papers. The terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United 

States, and war is what they got.Some in this chamber, and in our country, did not support 

the liberation of Iraq. Objections to war often come from principled motives. 

But let us be candid about the consequences of leaving Saddam Hussein in power. 

We're seeking all the facts. Already theKay Reportidentified dozens of 

weapons of mass destruction-related program activities and significant amounts 

of equipment that Iraq concealed from the United Nations. Had we failed to act, 

the dictator's weapons of mass destruction programs would continue to this day. 

Had we failed to act, Security Council resolutions on Iraq would have been 

revealed as empty threats, weakening the United Nations and encouraging defiance 

by dictators around the world. Iraq's torture chambers would still be filled 

with victims -- terrified and innocent. The killing fields of Iraq, where 

hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children vanished into the sands, would 

still be known only to the killers. For all who love freedom and peace, the 

world without Saddam Hussein's regime is a better and safer place!Some critics have said our duties in Iraq must be 

internationalized. This particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners 

in Britain, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Italy, 

Spain, Poland, Denmark, Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the Netherlands, 

Norway, El Salvador, and the 17 other countries that have committed troops to 

Iraq. As we debate at home, we must never ignore the vital contributions of our 

international partners, or dismiss their sacrifices. From the beginning, America 

has sought international support for our* operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we 

have gained much support. There is a difference, however, between leading a 

coalition of many nations, and submitting to the objections of a few. America 

will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country.We also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for 

the greater Middle East, where freedom is rare. Yet it is mistaken, and 

condescending, to assume that whole cultures and great religions are 

incompatible with liberty and self-government. I believe that God has planted in 

every human heart the desire to live in freedom. And even when that desire is crushed 

by tyranny for decades, it will rise again.As long as the Middle East remains a place of tyranny, 

despair, and anger, it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten 

the safety of America and our friends. So America is pursuing a forward strategy 

of freedom in the greater Middle East. We will challenge the enemies of reform, 

confront the allies of terror, and expect a higher standard from our friend

[sic]. To 

cut through the barriers of hateful propaganda, the Voice of America and other 

broadcast services are expanding their programming in Arabic and Persian -- and 

soon, a new television service will begin providing reliable news and 

information across the region. I will send you a proposal to double the budget 

of the National Endowment for Democracy, and to focus its new work on the 

development of free elections and free markets, free press, and free labor unions 

in the Middle East. And above all, we will finish the historic work of democracy 

in Afghanistan and Iraq, so those nations can light the way for others, and help 

transform a troubled part of the world.America is a Nation with a mission, and that mission comes 

from our most basic beliefs. We have no desire to dominate, no ambitions of 

empire. Our aim is a democratic peace -- a peace founded upon the dignity and 

rights of every man and woman. America acts in this cause with friends and 

allies at our side, yet we understand our special calling: This great Republic 

will lead the cause of freedom.In these last three years, adversity has also revealed the 

fundamental strengths of the American economy. We have come through recession, 

and terrorist attack, and corporate scandals, and the uncertainties of war. And 

because you acted to stimulate our economy with tax relief, this economy is 

strong, and growing stronger.You have doubled the child tax credit from 500 to a thousand 

dollars, reduced the marriage penalty, begun to phase out the death tax, reduced 

taxes on capital gains and stock dividends, cut taxes on small businesses, and 

you have lowered taxes for every American who pays income taxes.Americans took those dollars and put them to work, driving 

this economy forward. The pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 

was the fastest in nearly 20 years. New home construction: the highest in almost 

20 years. Home ownership rates: the highest ever. Manufacturing activity is 

increasing. Inflation is low. Interest rates are low. Exports are growing. 

Productivity is high. And jobs are on the rise.These numbers confirm that the American people are using 

their money far better than government would have, and you were right to return 

it.America's growing economy is also a changing economy. As 

technology transforms the way almost every job is done, America becomes more 

productive, and workers need new skills. Much of our job growth will be found in 

high-skilled fields like health care and biotechnology. So we must respond by 

helping more Americans gain the skills to find good jobs in our new economy.All skills begin with the basics of reading and math, which 

are supposed to be learned in the early grades of our schools. Yet for too long, 

for too many children, those skills were never mastered. By passing the No Child 

Left Behind Act, you have made the expectation of literacy the law of our 

country. We are providing more funding for our schools -- a 36 percent increase 

since 2001. We're requiring higher standards. We are regularly testing every 

child on the fundamentals. We are reporting results to parents, and making sure 

they have better options when schools are not performing. We are making progress 

toward excellence for every child in America.But the status quo always has defenders. Some want to 

undermine the No Child Left Behind Act by weakening standards and 

accountability. Yet the results we require are really a matter of common sense: 

We expect third graders to read and do math at the third grade level - and that's 

not asking too much. Testing is the only way to identify and help students who 

are falling behind.This Nation will not go back to the days of simply shuffling 

children along from grade to grade without them learning the basics. I refuse to 

give up on any child, and the No Child Left Behind Act is opening the door of 

opportunity to all of America's children.At the same time, we must ensure that older students and 

adults can gain the skills they need to find work now. Many of the 

fastest-growing occupations require strong math and science preparation, and 

training beyond the high school level. So tonight I propose a series of measures 

called Jobs for the 21st Century. This program will provide extra help to 

middle and high school students who fall behind in reading and math, expand 

Advanced Placement programs in low-income schools, invite math and science 

professionals from the private sector to teach part-time in our high schools. I 

propose larger Pell Grants for students who prepare for college with demanding 

courses in high school. I propose increasing our support for America's fine 

community colleges. I do so, so they can train workers for industries that are 

creating the most new jobs. By all these actions, we will help more and more 

Americans to join in the growing prosperity of our country.Job training is important, and so is job creation. We must 

continue to pursue an aggressive, pro-growth economic agenda.Congress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes. 

The tax reductions you passed are set to expire. Unless you act -- unless you 

act -- unless you act, the unfair tax 

on marriage will go back up. Unless you act, millions of families will be 

charged 300 dollars more in Federal taxes for every child. Unless you act, small 

businesses will pay higher taxes. Unless you act, the death tax will eventually 

come back to life. Unless you act, Americans face a tax increase. What  

Congress has given, the Congress should not take away: For the sake of job 

growth, the tax cuts you passed should be permanent.Our agenda for jobs and growth must help small business owners and employees 

with relief from needless federal regulation, and protect them from junk and 

frivolous lawsuits.Consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economy 

run, so I urge you to pass legislation to modernize our electricity system, 

promote conservation, and make America less dependent on foreign sources of 

energy.My administration is promoting free and fair trade to open up new markets for 

America's entrepreneurs and manufacturers and farmers -- to create jobs for 

American workers. Younger workers should have the opportunity to build a nest 

egg by saving part of their Social Security taxes in a personal retirement 

account. We should make the Social Security system a source of ownership for the 

American people. And we should limit the burden of government on this economy by 

acting as good stewards of taxpayers' dollars.In two weeks, I will send you a budget that funds the war, protects the 

homeland, and meets important domestic needs, while limiting the growth in 

discretionary spending to less than 4 percent. This will require that Congress 

focus on priorities, cut wasteful spending, and be wise with the People's money. 

By doing so, we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years.Tonight, I also ask you to reform our immigration laws so they reflect our 

values and benefit our economy. I propose a new temporary worker program to 

match willing foreign workers with willing employers when no Americans can be 

found to fill the job. This reform will be good for our economy because 

employers will find needed workers in an honest and orderly system. A temporary 

worker program will help protect our homeland, allowing Border Patrol and law 

enforcement to focus on true threats to our national security.I oppose amnesty, because it would encourage further illegal immigration, and 

unfairly reward those who break our laws. My temporary worker program will 

preserve the citizenship path for those who respect the law, while bringing 

millions of hardworking men and women out from the shadows of American life.Our nation's health care system, like our economy, is also in a time of 

change. Amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives. This 

dramatic progress has brought its own challenge, in the rising costs of medical 

care and health insurance. Members of Congress, we must work together to help 

control those costs and extend the benefits of modern medicine throughout our 

country.Meeting these goals requires bipartisan effort, and two months ago you showed 

the way. By strengthening Medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit, you 

kept a basic commitment to our seniors: You are giving them the modern medicine 

they deserve.Starting this year, under the law you passed, seniors can choose to receive a 

drug discount card, saving them 10 to 25 percent off the retail price of most 

prescription drugs -- and millions of low-income seniors can get an additional 

$600 to buy medicine. Beginning next year, seniors will have new coverage for 

preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease, and seniors just 

entering Medicare can receive wellness exams.In January of 2006, seniors can get prescription drug coverage under 

Medicare. For a monthly premium of about $35, most seniors who do not have that 

coverage today can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly in half. Under 

this reform, senior citizens will be able to keep their Medicare just as it is, 

or they can choose a Medicare plan that fits them best -- just as you, as 

members of Congress, can choose an insurance plan that meets your needs. And 

starting this year, millions of Americans will be able to save money tax-free 

for their medical expenses in a health savings account.I signed this measure proudly, and any attempt to limit the choices of our 

seniors, or to take away their prescription drug coverage under Medicare, will 

meet my veto.On the critical issue of health care, our goal is to ensure that Americans 

can choose and afford private health care coverage that best fits their 

individual needs. To make insurance more affordable, Congress must act to 

address rapidly rising health care costs. Small businesses should be able to 

band together and negotiate for lower insurance rates, so they can cover more 

workers with health insurance. I urge you to pass association health plans. I 

ask you to give lower-income Americans a refundable tax credit that would allow 

millions to buy their own basic health insurance.By computerizing health records, we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes, 

reduce costs, and improve care. To protect the doctor-patient relationship, and 

keep good doctors doing good work, we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous 

medical lawsuits.  And tonight I propose that individuals who buy 

catastrophic health care coverage, as part of our new health savings accounts, 

be allowed to deduct 100 percent of the premiums from their taxes.A government-run health care system is the wrong prescription.By keeping costs under control, expanding access, and helping more Americans 

afford coverage, we will preserve the system of private medicine that makes 

America's health care the best in the world.We are living in a time of great change -- in our world, in our economy, in 

science and medicine. Yet some things endure -- courage and compassion, 

reverence and integrity, respect for differences of faith and race. The values 

we try to live by never change. And they are instilled in us by fundamental 

institutions, such as families and schools and religious congregations. These 

institutions, these unseen pillars of civilization, must remain strong in 

America, and we will defend them. We must stand with our families to help them 

raise healthy, responsible children. When it comes to helping children make 

right choices, there is work for all of us to do.One of the worst decisions our children can make is to gamble their lives and 

futures on drugs. Our government is helping parents confront this problem with 

aggressive education, treatment, and law enforcement. Drug use in high school 

has declined by 11 percent over the last two years. Four hundred thousand fewer 

young people are using illegal drugs than in the year 2001. In my budget, I 

proposed new funding to continue our aggressive, community-based strategy to 

reduce demand for illegal drugs. Drug testing in our schools has proven to be an 

effective part of this effort. So tonight I proposed an additional $23 millions

[sic] for schools that want to use drug testing as 

a tool to save children's lives. The aim here is not to punish children, but to 

send them this message: We love you, and we don't want to lose you.To help children make right choices, they need good examples. Athletics play 

such an important role in our society, but, unfortunately, some in professional 

sports are not setting much of an example. The use of performance-enhancing 

drugs like steroids in baseball, football, and other sports is dangerous, and it 

sends the wrong message -- that there are shortcuts to accomplishment, and that 

performance is more important than character. So tonight I call on team owners, 

union representatives, coaches, and players to take the lead, to send the right 

signal, to get tough, and to get rid of steroids now.To encourage right choices, we must be willing to confront the dangers young 

people face even when they're difficult to talk about. Each year, about 3 

million teenagers contract sexually-transmitted diseases that can harm them, or 

kill them, or prevent them from ever becoming parents. In my budget, I propose a 

grassroots campaign to help inform families about these medical risks. We will 

double federal funding for abstinence programs, so schools can teach this fact 

of life: Abstinence for young people is the only certain way to avoid 

sexually-transmitted diseases.Decisions children now make can affect their health and character for the 

rest of their lives. All of us -- parents and schools and government -- must 

work together to counter the negative influence of the culture, and to send the 

right messages to our children.A strong America must also value the institution of marriage. I believe we 

should respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of the most 

fundamental, enduring institutions of our civilization. Congress has already 

taken a stand on this issue by passing theDefense of Marriage Act, 

signed in 1996 by President Clinton. That statute protects marriage under 

federal law as a union of a man and a woman, and declares that one state may not 

redefine marriage for other states.Activist judges, however, have begun redefining marriage by court order, 

without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives. On 

an issue of such great consequence, the people's voice must be heard. If judges 

insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative 

left to the people would be the constitutional process. Our nation must defend 

the sanctity of marriage.The outcome of this debate is important, and so is the way we conduct it. The 

same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that each individual has 

dignity and value in God's sight.It's also important to strengthen our communities by unleashing the 

compassion of America's religious institutions. Religious charities of every 

creed are doing some of the most vital work in our country -- mentoring 

children, feeding the hungry, taking the hand of the lonely. Yet government has 

often denied social service grants and contracts to these groups, just because 

they have a cross or a Star of David or a crescent on the wall. By executive 

order, I have opened billions of dollars in grant money to competition that 

includes faith-based charities. Tonight I ask you to codify this into law, so 

people of faith can know that the law will never discriminate against them 

again.In the past, we've worked together to bring mentors to children of prisoners, 

and provide treatment for the addicted, and help for the homeless. Tonight I ask 

you to consider another group of Americans in need of help. This year, some 

600,000 inmates will be released from prison back into society. We know from 

long experience that if they can't find work, or a home, or help, they are much 

more likely to commit crime and return to prison. So tonight, I propose a 

four-year, 300 million dollar prisoner re-entry initiative to expand job 

training and placement services, to provide transitional housing, and to help 

newly released prisoners get mentoring, including from faith-based groups. 

America is the land of second chance, and when the gates of the prison open, the 

path ahead should lead to a better life.For all Americans, the last three years have brought tests we did not ask 

for, and achievements shared by all. By our actions, we have shown what kind of 

nation we are. In grief, we have found the grace to go on. In challenge, we 

rediscovered the courage and daring of a free people. In victory, we have shown 

the noble aims and good heart of America. And having come this far, we sense 

that we live in a time set apart.I've been witness to the character of the people of America, who have shown 

calm in times of danger, compassion for one another, and toughness for the long 

haul. All of us have been partners in a great enterprise. And even some of the 

youngest understand that we are living in historic times. Last month a girl in 

Lincoln, Rhode Island, sent me a letter. It began, ""Dear George W. Bush. If 

there's anything you know, I, Ashley Pearson, age 2, age 10

[sic], can do to help anyone, please send me a 

letter and tell me what I can do to save our country."" She added this P.S.: ""If 

you can send a letter to the troops, please put, 'Ashley Pearson believes in 

you.'""Tonight, Ashley, your message to our troops has just been conveyed. And, yes, 

you have some duties yourself. Study hard in school, listen to your mom or dad, 

help someone in need, and when you and your friends see a man or woman in 

uniform, say, ""thank you."" And, Ashley, while you do your part, all of us here 

in this great chamber will do our best to keep you and the rest of America safe 

and free.My -- My fellow citizens, we now move forward, with confidence and faith. Our 

nation is strong and steadfast. The cause we serve is right, because it is the 

cause of all mankind. The momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable -- 

and it is not carried forward by our power alone. We can trust in that greater 

power who guides the unfolding of the years. And in all that is to come, we can 

know that His purposes are just and true.May God continue to bless America.Also in this database:2001,2002,2003,2005,2006,2007,20082009,20102011201220132014201520162017State of the Union AddressesText and Image Source:

		enjoy being in the company of entrepreneurs, risk-takers, dreamers and 
		doers. You all share a lot of common experiences. You've met challenges 
		of starting a business. And that's hard. It required more time than you 
		had in a day, more money than you kept in your bank, and more energy 
		than you thought you had. But you chose an interesting life -- you chose 
		to lead. You chose to follow your dreams. And I appreciate your spirit. 
		You're making the country a better place by working as hard as you do.As the Governor said, nearly half of all small 
		businesses are owned by women. That's powerful. That's a beautiful 
		statement. Firms owned by women are being started at more than twice the 
		national rate. The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well.This is a land of great wealth, and it's a land of great opportunity, 
		and you're seizing the opportunity. Through the hard work of our people, 
		the innovation of our businesses, and the good policies now in place, we 
		have put a recession behind us. Thanks in large part to your hard work, 
		our economy is expanding, productivity is strong, unemployment has been 
		falling, incomes are rising -- and we're going to stay on this path of 
		growth and prosperity in this country. Our economy has challenges, and 
		we know how to meet them. We'll continue making the finest products, and 
		selling those products not only here at home, but across the world. 
		We'll make sure that American workers have the education and the skills 
		to succeed in the jobs of the future. And we'll remain the leading 
		economy in the world, because America will remain the best place to do 
		business in the world.I want to thank Jennette Bradley, the Lt. Governor, for her hospitality. 
		And I want to thank the other officials from the state of Ohio who are 
		with us. I appreciate Elaine Chao, a member of my Cabinet, for joining 
		us today. Elaine is doing a great job for the United States. Es un 
		placer to be here with Hector Barreto, the head of the SBA.I traveled today with Steve LaTourette, the Congressman from this area. 
		Steve, I'm honored you're here. He's a pro-growth guy. He 
		knows the role of government is not to try to create wealth, but to 
		create an environment in which the entrepreneurial spirit can flourish. 
		I appreciate you being here. He's a great Congressman from this part of 
		the world.I appreciate the sponsors. Thanks for putting up with me and the 
		entourage. Most of all, thank you for being here.Today when I landed at the airport, I met Judi Firestone. Some of you 
		may know Judi. She's owned her own computer business since 1986. She's 
		an entrepreneur, she's a visionary. She works hard. As well, she is the 
		Northeast Ohio chairman for the ""Race For The Cure,"" Komen Foundation 
		""Race For The Cure."" She is a breast cancer survivor.The reason I bring her up is the true strength of America is the hearts 
		and souls of our citizens. The true strength of this country is the fact 
		there are people like Judi Firestone who are willing to volunteer their 
		time to make the community in which she lives a better place. It's 
		really the strength, isn't it? I mean, the truth of the matter is we can 
		change this country one heart and one soul at a time when citizens like 
		Judi take time out of her life, her busy life, to help somebody who 
		hurts.And so the reason I herald Judi Firestone is to really talk about the 
		strength of the country. I know many of you here heard the call to love 
		a neighbor like you'd like to be loved yourself. I want to thank you for 
		what you do to make your community a loving place. I want to thank you 
		for what you do to heal the souls that hurt. I want to thank you for 
		what you do to be a part of the incredibly important fabric of America, 
		that it saves lives not because of government, but because people are 
		volunteering their time. And if you're not volunteering, please do so. 
		The country needs you. But, Judi, thanks for coming.This economy of ours has faced challenges over the last three years. 
		Think back about what we have been through. Not long before I took 
		office in January of 2001, I invited business leaders from around our 
		country to come to Austin. They told me that factories and workers were 
		seeing the first signs of recession. That's what they said. They said 
		that the economy was troubled, that things weren't feeling too good. And 
		they were right. In fact, the manufacturing sector had started losing 
		jobs in August of 2000. By January of 2001, orders for equipment and 
		software were falling, the stock market had been declining for several 
		months.And as we started to come out of the recession, and the economy, because 
		of the entrepreneurial spirit and the fact we got great workers, started 
		to recover, the enemy hit us on September the 11th, 2001. It was a day 
		of terrible loss, deep mourning. It was also a serious blow to our 
		economy. The attacks closed the New York Stock Exchange for nearly a 
		week. Remember back to what it was like after September the 11th -- the 
		U.S. airspace was entirely closed for the first time. In the three 
		months after September the 11th, the economy lost nearly one million 
		jobs.The enemy hurt us. But we're plenty tough and determined as a nation. 
		And as a result of the American people's resolution and determination, 
		we began to recover. And then we learned about fraud and wrongdoing in 
		corporate America. And that hurt our economy, as well. There were 
		scandals that were in the years in making, shook the energy industry; it 
		affected the telecommunications industry; it hurt the accounting 
		profession, and other key sectors of our economy. A lot of innocent 
		workers and investors lost their jobs and their savings.Those scandals hurt. But we acted, and we passed the strongest corporate 
		reforms since Franklin Roosevelt held the office that I'm honored to 
		hold. Federal prosecutors are holding corporate executives to account. 
		We have made it clear, we will not tolerate dishonesty in the boardrooms 
		of America.This economy of ours had been through recession, had been through 
		emergency, had been through corporate scandals, and then I made the 
		necessary decision to deal with Saddam Hussein. September the 11th 
		taught a lesson I will never forget, and our country must never forget. 
		America must confront threats before they fully materialize. That's the 
		lesson of that fateful day.In Iraq, this administration looked at the intelligence and we saw a 
		threat to the American people. The Congress looked at the same 
		intelligence, and they saw a threat. The United Nations Security Council 
		looked at the intelligence and it saw a threat. And then the United 
		Nations Security Council, in 2002, gave Saddam Hussein a final chance to 
		comply with U.N. resolutions and disarm. We all saw a threat and we put 
		out, through resolutions, the demand that he disclose and disarm. And 
		once again, he chose defiance. He made the choice. I had a choice, as 
		well: either to trust the word of a madman, or to defend the American 
		people. Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time.And therefore, in 2002 and early 2003, the television screens across 
		America had banners saying, ""March to war"" -- and, as business leaders, 
		you understand that's not very conducive to investing capital. Marching 
		to war is not a positive thought. But we overcame that challenge. Thanks 
		to hardworking people and leaders, entrepreneurs, we overcame that 
		challenge. And now we're marching to peace.This week, the Iraqi Governing Council approved the new fundamental law, 
		which will be the basis for a free constitutional democracy in the heart 
		of the Middle East. Because we acted, because we did the right thing, 
		the world is becoming more peaceful, and America is more secure.My point is this: We faced challenge after challenge during the past 
		three years, and we're overcoming them all. Inflation is low; interest 
		rates are low; manufacturing activity is up; home ownership is at an 
		all-time high. The unemployment rate today is lower than the average 
		rate in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Thanks to our productive workers, 
		thanks to business leaders such as yourself, the United States of 
		America is the fastest-growing major industrialized economy in the 
		world.One of the main reasons the recession was one of the shortest in modern 
		history is because we acted. The tax relief I signed left money in the 
		pockets of families and job creators at just the right time. We cut the 
		taxes on our families; we lowered tax rates on everybody who paid taxes. 
		We didn't play the old political game of winners and losers in the tax 
		code. We increased the child credit, and we reduced the marriage 
		penalty. This helped to lift after-tax incomes in America by 8.4 percent 
		since 2001 -- (applause) -- and the spending and investing of Americans 
		is driving this economy forward. That's what's happening.Most of the new jobs in America are created by small businesses. I 
		understand that. And so that is why we focused a lot of our tax relief 
		on small businesses. The majority of small businesses are either sole 
		proprietorships or sub-chapter S corporations, which means many of you 
		pay business taxes at the individual rates. And so, therefore, when you 
		lower rates on individuals, you lower rates on small businesses. You 
		allow small business owners to keep more of their own money to invest, 
		and therefore, create more jobs.As well, to encourage investment, we increased the annual deduction for 
		equipment purchases by small businesses, from $25,000 to $100,000. You 
		see, I understand you can't have a healthy economy without a healthy 
		small business sector -- and the tax relief we passed is reinvigorating 
		small businesses all across this country.We did something else that will help the entrepreneurial spirit in this 
		country. We're phasing out the death tax. Small business owners and 
		ranchers and farmers shouldn't have their assets taxed twice. The death 
		tax is unfair. You ought to be able to pass your assets on to whoever 
		you want.Pro-growth policies are working. They're helping this economy -- the 
		economic recovery to turn into lasting prosperity. That's what I want, 
		and that's what's happening. Yet, the job report last week shows that 
		while the economy is dynamic and growing, it's experiencing some 
		fundamental change. Productivity has grown faster over the last two 
		years than at any time in more than 50 years, in part because technology 
		is changing the way we do things. You know what I'm talking about. 
		You're more productive in your companies.In some fields, one person can do the work that used to be done by many. 
		That's what being more productive means. At one semiconductor plant in 
		New Mexico, new technology is allowing the same number of workers to 
		produce 20 times as many computer chips as they used to.Higher productivity is a good thing. It's good for our workers, it is 
		good for our economy. If you're more productive, you're better able to 
		compete and survive and expand and grow. People think -- when they think 
		about productivity, you think of it this way: Operating heavy equipment 
		every day is hard work, but operating a shovel every day is harder work. 
		I don't think many people here want to trade in your laptop for one of 
		those old hunt-and-peck typewriters.Advances in productivity lead to higher wages -- that is a fact. The 
		more productive a worker becomes, the better wages that person will 
		receive. A more productive society means lower prices for consumers. A 
		more productive society is one that generates greater national wealth. 
		And small businesses are leading the way in this productivity 
		revolution. And for that, I'm grateful.Higher productivity also presents us a challenge, and here's the 
		challenge: Many companies fill new orders and expand operations without 
		needing to hire new workers. Because we're a productive work force, the 
		economy can expand, and in some cases, they don't need to add additional 
		workers to meet that expansion, to meet the additional demand. 
		Manufacturing output, for instance, increased sixfold between 1950 and 
		2000 -- a sixfold increase. Yet, because of high productivity, all this 
		manufacturing is done by about the same number of workers. And because 
		of the new technologies throughout the economy, another challenge is the 
		fact we've got to make sure people have got the skills necessary to 
		become productive workers.In Ohio, you know firsthand the effects of economic change. 
		Manufacturers are more productive, so they aren't creating as many jobs 
		as they used to. Ohio's unemployment rate is higher than the national 
		average; manufacturing communities like Youngstown and Cleveland have 
		been hit especially hard. I understand that. I know there are workers 
		here concerned about their jobs going overseas. I share that concern. I 
		know they're wondering whether they'll ever be able to find new skills 
		necessary to fill the new jobs of the 21st century. I understand that. 
		There are those with good jobs who worry about their health care and 
		their retirement benefits. There are a lot of moms and dads who wonder 
		whether or not their child will be able to find a job in the community 
		in which they were raised. There are legitimate concerns amongst people 
		here in Ohio and elsewhere around the country.And one reason why there's concern is because, as the economists say, 
		this is a time of transition, it's a time of change. And if you're one 
		going through transition, it's not an easy experience. But then we have 
		a responsibility to help. We have a responsibility to help with more 
		than just unemployment insurance. We have a responsibility in government 
		to create an environment that increases more jobs and helps people find 
		the skills to fill those jobs. That's a responsibility that we must do 
		in government.Some politicians in Washington see this new challenge, and yet they want 
		to respond in old ways. Their agenda is to increase federal taxes, to 
		build a wall around this country and to isolate America from the rest of 
		the world. They never get around to explaining how higher taxes would 
		help create a single job in America -- except maybe at the IRS. They 
		don't explain how closing off markets, closing off markets abroad would 
		help the millions of Americans who produce goods for export, or work for 
		foreign companies right here in the United States.That old policy of tax-and-spend is the enemy of job creation. The old 
		policy of economic isolationism is a recipe for economic disaster. 
		America has moved beyond that tired, defeatist mind-set, and we're not 
		going back. There's a better way, and that's what I want to talk about 
		today. To expand the creation of new jobs, and to see our workers 
		through our transition, government must meet basic responsibilities.First, instead of building barriers to trade, we must break down those 
		barriers so that good products, American products, are welcomed and sold 
		on every continent. Look at it this way: America has got 5 percent of 
		the world's population. That means 95 percent of potential customers are 
		in other countries. We cannot expect to sell our goods and services, and 
		create jobs, if America and our partners, trading partners, start 
		raising barriers and closing off markets.Millions of American jobs are supported by exports. That's a fact. One 
		in five factory jobs in this country directly depends on trade. The 
		surest way to threaten those jobs is a policy of economic isolation. The 
		surest way to add more jobs is a confident policy, a confident economic 
		policy that trades with the world.The economic isolationists have a pessimistic outlook; they don't show 
		much faith in the American worker or the American entrepreneur. They 
		don't think we can compete. But here in Ohio, you're proving them wrong. 
		People all over the world are buying products from Ohio -- cars and 
		tires, and batteries and jet engines, and ball bearings and electronics, 
		and crops from your farms. Since 1996, under NAFTA, Ohio's exports to 
		Mexico have tripled, and last year came to more than $2 billion -- $2 
		billion of exports means it's more likely somebody will have a job in 
		the state of Ohio. Since the end of 2000, Ohio's exports have increased 
		more than any state in the country. And why is that? Because this state 
		has got great entrepreneurs who are making high-quality products that 
		the world wants to buy. And another reason why is because you've got 
		great workers, who, if given a level playing field, can out-produce any 
		worker, anywhere on the Earth.Foreign companies recognize the quality of American workers, and that is 
		one of the reasons why so many have chosen to locate plants in our 
		country. More than 900 foreign facilities employ people here in the 
		state of Ohio -- including major companies like Honda. Ten percent of 
		Honda's international work force lives in this state. About 16,000 
		Ohioans work for Honda, with good, high-paying jobs. That's a lot of 
		your fellow citizens employed by a company that has chosen to do 
		business in America. And that's not counting the people who work at 165 
		different Ohio companies that supply Honda with parts and material.When politicians in Washington attack trade for political reasons, they 
		don't mention these workers, or the 6.4 million other Americans who draw 
		their paychecks from foreign companies. Economic isolationism would lead 
		to retaliation from abroad, and put many of those jobs at risk. Those 
		who play on fear and criticize trade are not serving the interests of 
		our workers. Across America -- from Marysville, Ohio, to Seattle, 
		Washington -- workers are better off -- better off -- because this 
		country is an optimistic, successful trading nation.My administration is committed to creating the jobs that trade brings. 
		It's a commitment of my administration. Remember this: Presidents of 
		both parties since World War II have made the decision to open up our 
		markets, for the good of American workers and for the good of American 
		consumers. If we're opening up our markets, it makes sense to get others 
		to open up theirs. And so we're dedicated to making sure that other 
		nations treat us fairly. That's why I pressed for free trade agreements 
		with Singapore and Chile. We want them to open up their markets to 
		America's goods and services. We've recently completed negotiations with 
		Morocco and Central America.I just completed a negotiation with Australia. I want you to understand 
		this important aspect of the trade agreement. Almost all manufacturing 
		exports to that country will be duty-free immediately. That means this 
		could help America's manufacturers sell another $2 billion worth of 
		goods to Australia every year. If we're going to let people sell here, 
		we ought to be encouraging them to let -- open up their markets, as 
		well. It's good for jobs, and it's good for America.I want the world to ""buy America."" The best products are those -- 
		Listen: The best product on any shelf anywhere in the world says, ""Made 
		in the USA.""To create more jobs, government must meet a second basic responsibility. 
		If we want to continue to out-perform the world, if we want to be able 
		to compete, America must remain the best place in the world to do 
		business. If we want to be competitive with other places, we've got to 
		be a good place for people to invest capital. We've got to make sure 
		that people who invest capital are not penalized by lousy government 
		policy. Tax cuts were vital to creating the environment for growth and 
		innovation, and there are more steps that need to be done.There needs to be fewer regulations on business owners in America. I bet 
		you spend a lot of time filling out paperwork. I bet not 
		much of your paperwork is ever read. The government needs to 
		let you focus on your business, on developing goods and services. It 
		needs to let you focus on hiring people, rather than spending hours 
		filling out paperwork. In order for us to keep jobs here at home and 
		expand the job base, we need better regulatory policy at the federal, 
		state, and local level.In order to make sure that we're able to create jobs here at home, and 
		to prevent jobs from going overseas, this country must have tort reform. 
		Frivolous lawsuits, or the threat of a frivolous lawsuit, create an 
		environment that is not conducive to job creation and job expansion. 
		There's a role at the federal level for tort reform. The trial lawyers 
		are tough up there, though. Members of the Senate need to 
		hear from you. The House has passed good tort legislation, but the 
		Senate has got to hear from you. Tort reform will help make it easier to 
		keep jobs here at home.We need to do something about the high cost of health care, as well. I'm 
		a strong proponent of association health plans to allow small business 
		to pool risk so you can better afford health care plans for your 
		employees. We've introduced a new concept called health savings 
		accounts, which will make a big difference for small business owners and 
		employees, as well. And the market has taken hold. We ought to -- 
		listen, frivolous lawsuits are running up the cost of health care in 
		America. Frivolous lawsuits against docs and hospitals are making it 
		harder for you to be able to afford health care. We need medical 
		liability reform at the federal level now.We're interested in making sure our jobs don't go overseas, and that 
		there's jobs available for citizens all across our country. We need 
		affordable and reliable supplies of energy. Here in Ohio, you know what 
		I'm talking about. You've experienced the disruption and 
		high cost when factories and cities lose power. It's time for our nation 
		to modernize the electricity systems. We need to promote clean coal 
		technology so we've got abundant supplies of energy. We need to explore 
		for more natural gas. We need to promote conservation. There's a lot of 
		things we need to do. One thing is for certain: In order to expand our 
		job base, we need to become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.Finally, to make sure this economy grows, to make sure the 
		entrepreneurial spirit is strong, we must have certainty in the tax 
		code. It's important for elected officials to understand that if you're 
		a business leader, if you're the CEO of a corporation, and you're 
		uncertain about your taxes from year to year, because of -- because the 
		tax policy is haphazard, it's hard for you to plan. It's hard for you to 
		think ahead. It's hard for you to be confident in your investment 
		strategy.Part of the issues we face here in the future of this country is the 
		fact that the tax relief we passed is going to expire. The marriage 
		penalty will go back up. By the way, that doesn't make any sense to have 
		a marriage penalty in the tax code when you're trying to encourage 
		marriage in the country. The child credit will go back down if Congress 
		doesn't act. The death tax will eventually come back to life. Imagine 
		what it's going to be like in 2011, when it's supposed to come back to 
		life. There's going to be a lot of people maybe trying to die a little 
		earlier to avoid the -- It's unbelievable when you think 
		about it. Think about public policy that says: Your taxes are going to 
		be down this year, but not. We may have increased expensing allowances, 
		or not. Uncertainty in the tax code makes it hard for the job base to 
		continue to expand. For the sake of job creation, Congress needs to make 
		tax relief permanent.The third basic responsibility is to make sure American workers are 
		prepared for successful careers in the new economy. Some sectors are 
		producing fewer jobs, but in other areas, jobs are growing. They're 
		multiplying. There's a lot of opportunity in a changing economy. Here in 
		Ohio, there's a shortage of nurses and pharmacists and other skilled 
		professionals. And so any viable economic strategy, pro-growth strategy, 
		must be to help people find new skills, to gain new skills, to be able 
		to fill the new jobs of the 21st century. If you're in a period of 
		transition, you must help people make that transition.All skills start with education. I'm a strong proponent of the 
		legislation we passed in Washington called the No Child Left Behind Act. 
		This is a good piece of legislation which is challenging the soft 
		bigotry of low expectations. We've raised the bar. See, we believe every 
		child can learn to read and write and add and subtract. That's what we 
		believe. And therefore, we expect every child to achieve those skills. 
		And therefore, we're expecting, in return for federal money, the school 
		districts to measure, because if you don't measure, how do you know. 
		We've just got to stop this practice of shuffling kids through the 
		school as if they don't matter. What matters is every child gets a basic 
		education. And if you can't read, you're not going to be able to take 
		advantage of the new jobs of the 21st century. And that's why -- that's 
		why we're focused on secondary schools, and that's why we've got plans 
		to help high school students who've fallen behind in reading and math to 
		gain the skills necessary to be able to work in this new economy.We've got programs to help workers who've been displaced by the effects 
		of trade, by giving them assistance in job training and health care and 
		relocation. I proposed what's called personal reemployment accounts for 
		people who need extra help so they can pay for child care and 
		transportation and other costs of finding work. In other words, we're 
		trying to help people.But we've got a plan, as well -- it's an important plan that's going to 
		make a big difference, and that is to help the community colleges train 
		workers for jobs which actually exist. Community colleges need to listen 
		to the business community and the community in which they live. They 
		need to ask the question, what do we need to do to train workers? What 
		are you looking for? What kind of skill set is necessary for you to hire 
		this person? They need to be flexible. The curriculums must be willing 
		to change. The community college system has got a fantastic opportunity 
		to make sure workers gain the skills necessary to become employable in 
		this changing economy.I was in Toledo recently and talked with a guy named Mike Potter. He 
		lost a manufacturing job. He went back to the community college to get 
		retrained. He got help. The government paid. And he got retrained and he 
		found a new job because he was willing to go back to school, and the 
		community college listened to the employers in the community in which he 
		lived.I was in Northern Virginia, and went to a community college system. I 
		met Connie Mitchell. She heard there was jobs available in the health 
		industry. And by the way, there's a lot of jobs being created in the 
		health industry. And so she went to the community college, and they gave 
		her the skills necessary to become a nurse. And now she's employed.In Mesa, Arizona, I met a Stacey Leedom, who's a single mom -- which, by 
		the way, is the hardest job in America, being a single mom. She was a 
		graphic artist. She had worked for a company, I think, for 12 or 13 
		years. She got help to go back to Mesa Community College. She learned a 
		new skill in the computer industry. And in her first year of a new job, 
		she made more than she did after 12 years as a graphic artist.You see, if you become a more productive citizen, you'll make more 
		money. Better productivity, better skills means higher pay. And our 
		country must focus our education system on helping workers learn the new 
		skills of the 21st century so we can increase the job base of this 
		country.You know, it wasn't all that long ago that some people said that America 
		was not up to global competition. I don't know if you remember back in 
		the '70s and '80s -- that's what we heard, though, wasn't it -- that we 
		couldn't compete with the Japanese, that they were too good at being 
		automobile makers, that foreign companies would soon overtake our own, 
		that we just weren't up to it. That's what a lot of people said in that 
		period. We were told that American companies weren't flexible enough; 
		American workers were not disciplined enough; and American products 
		weren't good enough.Well, the pessimists were wrong. American companies remade themselves to 
		beat the competition. Great ideas for improvement came from our work 
		force, workers who are on the line. And the leaders of those companies 
		listened. The entrepreneurial spirit was strong in America, and it was 
		the American entrepreneur that invented new technologies, technologies 
		that have made this country the most productive in the world. Our 
		economy performed like never before, and today, no one doubts what 
		nation's economy leads this world.Our nation in 2004 is vibrant. As opposed to retreating like the 
		pessimists thought, we're selling computer chips to Japan. We're 
		producing BMWs in Greer, South Carolina, for export to Germany. We're 
		even exporting California wine to France.There are people who doubt our ability to compete. There are economic 
		isolationists who surrender and wall us off. It's bad for the country, 
		bad for consumers. It's bad for workers. We'll prove the pessimists 
		wrong again. We'll continue to open up untapped markets for American 
		workers and businesses. We'll keep this government on the side of growth 
		and job creation, so American businesses can compete and prosper. We'll 
		focus on job training and education, so Americans can improve their 
		skills and improve their lives. We'll get the policies right, and the 
		American people will do the rest. You will show, once again, that this 
		nation has the energy and the confidence and the creativity to meet 
		every challenge.I want to thank you for your leadership. I want to thank you for your 
		spirit. I want to thank you for working hard to realize the American 
		Dream and own your own business. I want to thank you for employing 
		people. I want to thank you for the faith of your country.May God bless you, and may God continue to bless America.",trade woman business forum job trade woman business forumdelivered march cleveland

for pdfPresident 
Bush:Good evening. Before I take your questions, let me speak with 
the American people about the situation in Iraq.This has been tough weeks in that country. Coalition forces have encountered 
serious violence in some areas of Iraq. Our military commanders report that this 
violence is being instigated by three groups: Some remnants of Saddam Hussein's 
regime, along with Islamic militants have attacked coalition forces in the city 
of Fallujah. Terrorists from other countries have infiltrated Iraq to incite and 
organize attacks. In the south of Iraq, coalition forces face riots and attacks 
that are being incited by a radical cleric named al-Sadr. He has assembled some 
of his supporters into an illegal militia, and publicly supported the terrorist 
groups, Hamas and Hezbollah. Al-Sadr's methods of violence and intimidation are 
widely repudiated by other Iraqi Shia. He's been indicted by Iraqi authorities 
for the murder of a prominent Shia cleric.Although these instigations of violence come from different factions, they 
share common goals. They want to run us out of Iraq and destroy the democratic 
hopes of the Iraqi people. The violence we have seen is a power grab by these 
extreme and ruthless elements.It's not a civil war; it's not a popular uprising. Most of Iraq is relatively 
stable. Most Iraqis, by far, reject violence and oppose dictatorship. In forums 
where Iraqis have met to discuss their political future, and in all the 
proceedings of the Iraqi Governing Council, Iraqis have expressed clear 
commitments. They want strong protections for individual rights; they want their 
independence; and they want their freedom.America's commitment to freedom in Iraq is consistent with our ideals, and 
required by our interests. Iraq will either be a peaceful, democratic country, 
or it will again be a source of violence, a haven for terror, and a threat to 
America and to the world. By helping to secure a free Iraq, Americans serving in 
that country are protecting their fellow citizens. Our nation is grateful to 
them all, and to their families that face hardship and long separation.This weekend, at a Fort Hood hospital, I presented a Purple Heart to some of 
our wounded; had the honor of thanking them on behalf of all Americans. Other 
men and women have paid an even greater cost. Our nation honors the memory of 
those who have been killed, and we pray that their families will find God's 
comfort in the midst of their grief. As I have said to those who have lost loved 
ones, we will finish the work of the fallen.America's armed forces are performing brilliantly, with all the skill and 
honor we expect of them. We're constantly reviewing their needs. Troop strength, 
now and in the future, is determined by the situation on the ground. If 
additional forces are needed, I will send them. If additional resources are 
needed, we will provide them. The people of our country are united behind our 
men and women in uniform, and this government will do all that is necessary to 
assure the success of their historic mission.One central commitment of that mission is the transfer of sovereignty back to 
the Iraqi people. We have set a deadline of June 30th. It is important that we 
meet that deadline. As a proud and independent people, Iraqis do not support an 
indefinite occupation -- and neither does America. We're not an imperial power, 
as nations such as Japan and Germany can attest. We are a liberating power, as 
nations in Europe and Asia can attest, as well. America's objective in Iraq is 
limited, and it is firm: We seek an independent, free and secure Iraq.Were the coalition to step back from the June 30th pledge, many Iraqis would 
question our intentions and feel their hopes betrayed. And those in Iraq who 
trade in hatred and conspiracy theories would find a larger audience and gain a 
stronger hand. We will not step back from our pledge. On June 30th, Iraqi 
sovereignty will be placed in Iraqi hands.Sovereignty involves more than a date and a ceremony. It requires Iraqis to 
assume responsibility for their own future. Iraqi authorities are now 
confronting the security challenge of the last several weeks. In Fallujah, 
coalition forces have suspended offensive operations, allowing members of the 
Iraqi Governing Council and local leaders to work on the restoration of central 
authority in that city. These leaders are communicating with the insurgents to 
ensure an orderly turnover of that city to Iraqi forces, so that the resumption 
of military action does not become necessary. They're also insisting that those 
who killed and mutilated four American contract workers be handed over for trial 
and punishment. In addition, members of the Governing Council are seeking to 
resolve the situation in the south. Al-Sadr must answer the charges against him 
and disband his illegal militia.Our coalition is standing with responsible Iraqi leaders as they establish 
growing authority in their country. The transition to sovereignty requires that 
we demonstrate confidence in Iraqis, and we have that confidence. Many Iraqi 
leaders are showing great personal courage, and their example will bring out the 
same quality in others. The transition to sovereignty also requires an 
atmosphere of security, and our coalition is working to provide that security. 
We will continue taking the greatest care to prevent harm to innocent civilians; 
yet we will not permit the spread of chaos and violence. I have directed our 
military commanders to make every preparation to use decisive force, if 
necessary, to maintain order and to protect our troops.The nation of Iraq is moving toward self-rule, and Iraqis and Americans will 
see evidence in the months to come. On June 30th, when the flag of free Iraq is 
raised, Iraqi officials will assume full responsibility for the ministries of 
government. On that day, the transitional administrative law, including a bill 
of rights that is unprecedented in the Arab world, will take full effect.The United States, and all the nations of our coalition, will establish 
normal diplomatic relations with the Iraqi government. An American embassy will 
open, and an American ambassador will be posted.According to the schedule already approved by the Governing Council, Iraq 
will hold elections for a national assembly no later than next January. That 
assembly will draft a new, permanent constitution which will be presented to the 
Iraqi people in a national referendum held in October of next year. Iraqis will 
then elect a permanent government by December 15, 2005 -- an event that will 
mark the completion of Iraq's transition from dictatorship to freedom.Other nations and international institutions are stepping up to their 
responsibilities in building a free and secure Iraq. We're working closely with 
the United Nations envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, and with Iraqis to determine the 
exact form of the government that will receive sovereignty on June 30th. The 
United Nations election assistance team, headed by Karina Parelli (phonetic), is 
in Iraq, developing plans for next January's election. NATO is providing support 
for the Polish-led multinational division in Iraq. And 17 of NATO's 26 members 
are contributing forces to maintain security.Secretary of State Powell and Secretary of State Rumsfeld, and a number of 
NATO defense and foreign ministers are exploring a more formal role for NATO, 
such as turning the Polish-led division into a NATO operation, and giving NATO 
specific responsibilities for border control.Iraqi's neighbors also have responsibilities to make their region more 
stable. So I am sending Deputy Secretary of State Armitage to the Middle East to 
discuss with these nations our common interest in a free and independent Iraq, 
and how they can help achieve this goal.As we've made clear all along, our commitment to the success and security of 
Iraq will not end on June 30th. On July 1st, and beyond, our reconstruction 
assistance will continue, and our military commitment will continue. Having 
helped Iraqis establish a new government, coalition military forces will help 
Iraqis to protect their government from external aggression and internal 
subversion.The success of free government in Iraq is vital for many reasons. A free Iraq 
is vital because 25 million Iraqis have as much right to live in freedom as we 
do. A free Iraq will stand as an example to reformers across the Middle East. A 
free Iraq will show that America is on the side of Muslims who wish to live in 
peace, as we have already shown in Kuwait and Kosovo, Bosnia and Afghanistan. A 
free Iraq will confirm to a watching world that America's word, once given, can 
be relied upon, even in the toughest times.Above all, the defeat of violence and terror in Iraq is vital to the defeat 
of violence and terror elsewhere; and vital, therefore, to the safety of the 
American people. Now is the time, and Iraq is the place, in which the enemies of 
the civilized world are testing the will of the civilized world. We must not 
waver.The violence we are seeing in Iraq is familiar. The terrorist who takes 
hostages, or plants a roadside bomb near Baghdad is serving the same ideology of 
murder that kills innocent people on trains in Madrid, and murders children on 
buses in Jerusalem, and blows up a nightclub in Bali, and cuts the throat of a 
young reporter for being a Jew.We've seen the same ideology of murder in the killing of 241 Marines in 
Beirut, the first attack on the World Trade Center, in the destruction of two 
embassies in Africa, in the attack on the USS Cole, and in the merciless horror 
inflicted upon thousands of innocent men and women and children on September the 
11th, 2001.None of these acts is the work of a religion; all are the work of a 
fanatical, political ideology. The servants of this ideology seek tyranny in the 
Middle East and beyond. They seek to oppress and persecute women. They seek the 
death of Jews and Christians, and every Muslim who desires peace over theocratic 
terror. They seek to intimidate America into panic and retreat, and to set free 
nations against each other. And they seek weapons of mass destruction, to 
blackmail and murder on a massive scale.Over the last several decades, we've seen that any concession or retreat on 
our part will only embolden this enemy and invite more bloodshed. And the enemy 
has seen, over the last 31 months, that we will no longer live in denial or seek 
to appease them. For the first time, the civilized world has provided a 
concerted response to the ideology of terror -- a series of powerful, effective 
blows.The terrorists have lost the shelter of the Taliban and the training camps in 
Afghanistan. They've lost safe havens in Pakistan. They lost an ally in Baghdad. 
And Libya has turned its back on terror. They've lost many leaders in an 
unrelenting international manhunt. And perhaps most frightening to these men and 
their movement, the terrorists are seeing the advance of freedom and reform in 
the greater Middle East.A desperate enemy is also a dangerous enemy, and our work may become more 
difficult before it is finished. No one can predict all the hazards that lie 
ahead, or the costs they will bring. Yet, in this conflict, there is no safe 
alternative to resolute action. The consequences of failure in Iraq would be 
unthinkable. Every friend of America and Iraq would be betrayed to prison and 
murder as a new tyranny arose. Every enemy of America and the world would 
celebrate, proclaiming our weakness and decadence, and using that victory to 
recruit a new generation of killers.We will succeed in Iraq. We're carrying out a decision that has already been 
made and will not change: Iraq will be a free, independent country, and America 
and the Middle East will be safer because of it. Our coalition has the means and 
the will to prevail. We serve the cause of liberty, and that is, always and 
everywhere, a cause worth serving.Now, I'll be glad to take your questions. I will start with you.Question:Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, April is turning into the 
deadliest month in Iraq since the fall of Baghdad, and some people are comparing 
Iraq to Vietnam and talking about a quagmire. Polls show that support for your 
policy is declining and that fewer than half Americans now support it. What does 
that say to you and how do you answer the Vietnam comparison?President 
Bush:I think the analogy is false. I also happen to think that 
analogy sends the wrong message to our troops, and sends the wrong message to 
the enemy. Look, this is hard work. It's hard to advance freedom in a country 
that has been strangled by tyranny. And, yet, we must stay the course, because 
the end result is in our nation's interest.A secure and free Iraq is an historic opportunity to change the world and 
make America more secure. A free Iraq in the midst of the Middle East will have 
incredible change. It's hard -- freedom is not easy to achieve. We had a little 
trouble in our country achieving freedom. And we've been there a year, Terry. I 
know it seems like a long time, it seems like a long time to the loved ones 
whose troops have been overseas. But when you think about where the country has 
come from, it's a relatively short period of time. And we're making progress.There's no question it's been a tough, tough series of weeks for the American 
people. It's been really tough for the families. I understand that. It's been 
tough on this administration. But we're doing the right thing.And as to whether or not I make decisions based upon polls, I don't. I just 
don't make decisions that way. I fully understand the consequences of what we're 
doing. We're changing the world. And the world will be better off and America 
will be more secure as a result of the actions we're taking.Question:Thank you, Mr. President. What's your best prediction on how long U.S. 
troops will have to be in Iraq? And it sounds like you will have to add some 
troops; is that a fair assessment?President 
Bush:Well, I -- first of all, that's up to General Abizaid, and 
he's clearly indicating that he may want more troops. It's coming up through the 
chain of command. If that's what he wants, that's what he gets. Generally, we've 
had about 115,000 troops in Iraq. There's 135,000 now, as a result of the 
changeover from one division to the next. If he wants to keep troops there to 
help, I'm more than willing to say, ""Yes, General Abizaid.""I talk to General Abizaid quite frequently. I'm constantly asking him, does 
he have what he needs -- whether it be in troop strength, or in equipment. He 
and General Sanchez talk all the time. And if he makes the recommendation, he'll 
get it.In terms of how long we'll be there: as long as necessary, and not one day 
more. The Iraqi people need us there to help with security. They need us there 
to fight off these violent few who are doing everything they can to resist the 
advance of freedom. And I mentioned who they are.And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our commanders on the ground have 
got the authority necessary to deal with violence, and will -- and will in firm 
fashion. And that's what, by far, the vast majority of the Iraqis want -- they 
want security so they can advance toward a free society.Once we transfer sovereignty, we'll enter into a security agreement with the 
government to which we pass sovereignty, the entity to which we pass 
sovereignty. And we'll need to be there for a while. We'll also need to continue 
training the Iraqi troops. I was disappointed in the performance of some of the 
troops. Some of the units performed brilliantly; some of them didn't, and we 
need to find out why.If they're lacking equipment, we'll get them equipment. If there needs to be 
more intense training, we'll get more intense training. But, eventually, Iraq's 
security is going to be handled by the Iraqi people, themselves.Let's see here -- Terry.Question:Mr. President, before the war, you and members of your administration made 
several claims about Iraq that U.S. troops would be greeted as liberators with 
sweets and flowers, that Iraqi oil revenue would pay for most of the 
reconstruction; and that Iraq not only had weapons of mass destruction, but as 
Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said, we know where they are. How do you explain 
to Americans how you got that so wrong? And how do you answer your opponents, 
who say that you took this nation to war on the basis of what have turned out to 
be a series a false premises?President 
Bush:Well, let me step back and review my thinking prior to going 
into Iraq. First, the lesson of September the 11th is, when this nation sees a 
threat, a gathering threat, we've got to deal with it. We can no longer hope 
that oceans protect us from harm. Every threat we must take seriously.Saddam Hussein was a threat. He was a threat because he had used weapons of 
mass destruction on his own people. He was a threat because he coddled 
terrorists. He was a threat because he funded suiciders. He was a threat to the 
region. He was a threat to the United States. That's the assessment that I made 
from the intelligence, the assessment that Congress made from the intelligence; 
that's the exact same assessment that the United Nations Security Council made 
with the intelligence.I went to the U.N., as you might recall, and said, either you take care of 
him, or we will. Any time an American President says, if you don't, we will, we 
better be prepared to. And I was prepared to. I thought it was important for the 
United Nations Security Council that when it says something, it means something, 
for the sake of security in the world. See, the war on terror had changed the 
calculations. We needed to work with people. People needed to come together to 
work. And, therefore, empty words would embolden the actions of those who are 
willing to kill indiscriminately.The United Nations passed a Security Council resolution unanimously that 
said, disarm or face serious consequences. And he refused to disarm.I thought it was very interesting that Charlie Duelfer, who just came back -- 
he's the head of the Iraqi Survey Group -- reported some interesting findings 
from his recent tour there. And one of the things was, he was amazed at how 
deceptive the Iraqis had been toward UNMOVIC and UNSCOM; deceptive in hiding 
things. We knew they were hiding things -- a country that hides something is a 
country that is afraid of getting caught. And that was part of our calculation. 
Charlie confirmed that. He also confirmed that Saddam had a -- the ability to 
produce biological and chemical weapons. In other words, he was a danger. He had 
long-range missiles that were undeclared to the United Nations; he was a danger. 
And so we dealt with him.What else -- part of the question -- oh, oil revenues. Well, the oil revenues 
are -- they're bigger than we thought they would be at this point in time. I 
mean, one year after the liberation of Iraq, the revenues of the oil stream is 
pretty darn significant. One of the things I was concerned about prior to going 
into Iraq was that the oil fields would be destroyed. But they weren't, they're 
now up and running. And that money is -- it will benefit the Iraqi people. It's 
their oil, and they'll use it to reconstruct the country.Finally, the attitude of the Iraqis toward the American people -- it's an 
interesting question. They're really pleased we got rid of Saddam Hussein. And 
you can understand why. This is a guy who was a torturer, a killer, a maimer; 
there's mass graves. I mean, he was a horrible individual that really shocked 
the country in many ways, shocked it into a kind of -- a fear of making 
decisions toward liberty. That's what we've seen recently. Some citizens are 
fearful of stepping up. And they were happy -- they're not happy they're 
occupied. I wouldn't be happy if I were occupied either. They do want us there 
to help with security, and that's why this transfer of sovereignty is an 
important signal to send, and it's why it's also important for them to hear we 
will stand with them until they become a free country.Elisabeth.Question:Thank you, Mr. President. To move to the 9/11 Commission. You, yourself, 
have acknowledged that Osama bin Laden was not a central focus of the 
administration in the months before September 11th. ""I was not on point,"" you 
told the journalist, Bob Woodward, ""I didn't feel that sense of urgency."" 
Two-and-a-half years later, do you feel any sense of personal responsibility for 
September 11th?President 
Bush:Let me put that quote to Woodward in context. He had asked me 
if I was -- something about killing bin Laden. That's what the question was. And 
I said, compared to how I felt at the time, after the attack, I didn't have that 
-- I also went on to say, my blood wasn't boiling, I think is what the quote 
said. I didn't see -- I mean, I didn't have that great sense of outrage that I 
felt on September the 11th. I was -- on that day I was angry and sad: angry that 
al Qaeda had -- well, at the time, thought al Qaeda, found out shortly 
thereafter it was al Qaeda -- had unleashed this attack; sad for those who lost 
their life.Your question -- do I feel --Question:Do you feel a sense of personal responsibility for September 11th?President 
Bush:I feel incredibly grieved when I meet with family members, and 
I do quite frequently. I grieve for the incredible loss of life that they feel, 
the emptiness they feel.There are some things I wish we'd have done when I look back. I mean, 
hindsight is easy. It's easy for a President to stand up and say, now that I 
know what happened, it would have been nice if there were certain things in 
place; for example, a homeland security department. And why I -- I say that 
because it's -- that provides the ability for our agencies to coordinate better 
and to work together better than it was before.I think the hearings will show that the Patriot Act is an important change in 
the law that will allow the FBI and the CIA to better share information 
together. We were kind of stove-piped, I guess is a way to describe it. There 
was kind of -- departments that at times didn't communicate, because of law, in 
the FBI's case.And the other thing I look back on and realize is that we weren't on a war 
footing. The country was not on a war footing, and yet the enemy was at war with 
us. And it's -- it didn't take me long to put us on a war footing. And we've 
been on war ever since. The lessons of 9/11 that I -- one lesson was, we must 
deal with gathering threats. And that's part of the reason I dealt with Iraq the 
way I did.The other lesson is, is that this country must go on the offense and stay on 
the offense. In order to secure the country, we must do everything in our power 
to find these killers and bring them to justice, before they hurt us again. I'm 
afraid they want to hurt us again. They're still there.They can be right one time; we've got to be right a hundred percent of the 
time in order to protect the country. It's a mighty task. But our government has 
changed since the 9/11 attacks. We're better equipped to respond; we're better 
at sharing intelligence. But we've still got a lot of work to do.Dave.Question:Mr. President, I'd like to follow up on a couple of these questions that 
have been asked. One of the biggest criticisms of you is that whether it's WMD 
in Iraq, postwar planning in Iraq, or even the question of whether this 
administration did enough to ward off 9/11, you never admit a mistake. Is that a 
fair criticism? And do you believe there were any errors in judgment that you 
made related to any of those topics I brought up?President 
Bush:Well, I think, as I mentioned, it's -- the country wasn't on 
war footing, and yet we're at war. And that's just a reality, Dave. I mean, 
that's -- that was the situation that existed prior to 9/11, because the truth 
of the matter is, most in the country never felt that we'd be vulnerable to an 
attack such as the one that Osama bin Laden unleashed on us. We knew he had 
designs on us, we knew he hated us. But there was a -- nobody in our government, 
at least, and I don't think the prior government, could envision flying 
airplanes into buildings on such a massive scale.The people know where I stand. I mean, in terms of Iraq, I was very clear 
about what I believed. And, of course, I want to know why we haven't found a 
weapon yet. But I still know Saddam Hussein was a threat, and the world is 
better off without Saddam Hussein. I don't think anybody can -- maybe people can 
argue that. I know the Iraqi people don't believe that, that they're better off 
with Saddam Hussein -- would be better off with Saddam Hussein in power. I also 
know that there's an historic opportunity here to change the world. And it's 
very important for the loved ones of our troops to understand that the mission 
is an important, vital mission for the security of America and for the ability 
to change the world for the better.Let's see -- Ed.Question:Mr. President, good evening. You've talked on the -- I'd like to ask you 
about the August 6th PDB.President 
Bush:Sure.Question:You mentioned it at Fort Hood on Sunday. You said -- you pointed out that 
it did not warn of a hijacking of airplanes to crash into buildings, but that it 
warned of hijacking to, obviously, take hostages and to secure the release of 
extremists being held by the U.S. Did that trigger some specific actions on your 
part and the administration, since it dealt with potentially hundreds of lives 
and a blackmail attempt on the United States government?President 
Bush:Ed, I asked for the briefing. And the reason I did is because 
there had been a lot of threat intelligence from overseas. And so -- part of it 
had to do with Genoa, the G8 conference that I was going to attend. And I asked, 
at that point in time, let's make sure we are paying attention here at home, as 
well. And that's what triggered the report.The report, itself, I've characterized as mainly history, and I think when 
you look at it you'll see that it was talking about '97 and '98 and '99. It was 
also an indication, as you mentioned, that bin Laden might want to hijack an 
airplane, but as you said, not to fly into a building, but perhaps to release a 
person in jail. In other words, serve it as a blackmail.And of course, that concerns me. All those reports concern me. As a matter of 
fact, I was dealing with terrorism a lot as the President when George Tenet came 
in to brief me. I mean, that's where I got my information. I changed the way 
that -- the relationship between the President and the CIA Director. And I 
wanted Tenet in the Oval Office all the time. And we had briefings about 
terrorist threats. This was a summary.Now, in what's called the PDB, there was a warning about bin Laden's desires 
on America, but, frankly, I didn't think that was anything new. Major newspapers 
had talked about bin Laden's desires on hurting America. What was interesting in 
there was that there was a report that the FBI was conducting field 
investigations. And I -- that was good news that they were doing their job.The way my administration worked, Ed, is that I met with Tenet all the time, 
obviously met with my principals a lot. We talked about threats that had 
emerged. We had a counterterrorism group meeting on a regular basis to analyze 
the threats that came in. Had there been a threat that required action by 
anybody in the government, I would have dealt with it. In other words, had they 
come up and said, this is where we see something happening, you can rest assured 
that the people of this government would have responded, and responded in a 
forceful way.I mean, one of the things about Elisabeth's question was, I step back and 
I've asked myself a lot, is there anything we could have done to stop the 
attacks. Of course, I've asked that question -- as have many people of my 
government. Nobody wants this to happen to America. And the answer is that had I 
had any inkling whatsoever that the people were going to fly airplanes into 
buildings, we would have moved heaven and earth to save the country -- just like 
we're working hard to prevent a further attack.Let's see -- Jim.Question:Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned the PDB and the assurance you got 
that the FBI was working on terrorism investigations here. The number they had 
used was 70. But we learned today in the September 11th hearings that the Acting 
Director of the FBI at the time says -- now says the FBI tells him that number 
was wrong, that he doesn't even know how it got into your PDB. And two of the 
commissioners strongly suggested the number was exaggerated. Have you learned 
anything else about that report since that time? And do you now believe you were 
falsely comforted by the FBI?President 
Bush:No, I heard about that today, obviously, and my response to 
that was I expect to get valid information. As the ultimate decision-maker for 
this country, I expect information that comes to my desk to be real and valid. 
And I presume the 9/11 Commission will find out -- will follow up on his 
suggestions and his recollection and garner the truth.That is an important part of the 9/11 Commission's job, is to analyze what 
went on and what could have, perhaps, been done differently so that we can 
better secure America for the future. But, of course, I expect to get valid 
information. I can't make good decisions unless I get valid information.Question:Has the FBI come back to you, sir?President 
Bush:No, I haven't talked to anybody today. But I will, though. 
We'll find out.John.Question:Thank you, Mr. President. Two weeks ago, a former counterterrorism official 
at the NSC, Richard Clarke, offered an unequivocal apology to the American 
people for failing them prior to 9/11. Do you believe the American people 
deserve a similar apology from you, and would you be prepared to give them one?President 
Bush:Look, I can understand why people in my administration 
anguished over the fact that people lost their life. I feel the same way. I 
mean, I'm sick when I think about the death that took place on that day. And as 
I mentioned, I've met with a lot of family members and I do the best I do to 
console them about the loss of their loved one. As I mentioned, I oftentimes 
think about what I could have done differently. I can assure the American people 
that had we had any inkling that this was going to happen, we would have done 
everything in our power to stop the attack.Here's what I feel about that. The person responsible for the attacks was 
Osama bin Laden. That's who's responsible for killing Americans. And that's why 
we will stay on the offense until we bring people to justice.John.Question:Mr. President, thank you. You mentioned 17 of the 26 NATO members providing 
some help on the ground in Iraq. But if you look at the numbers -- 135,000 U.S. 
troops, 10,000 or 12,000 British troops, then the next largest, perhaps even the 
second largest contingent of guns on the ground are private contractors -- 
literally, hired guns. Your critics,including your Democratic opponent, say that's proof to them your coalition 
is window dressing. How would you answer those critics? And can you assure the 
American people that post-sovereignty, when the handover takes place, that there 
will be more burden sharing by allies, in terms of security forces?President 
Bush:John, my response is, I don't think people ought to demean the 
contributions of our friends into Iraq. People are sacrificing their lives in 
Iraq, from different countries. We ought to honor that, and we ought to welcome 
that. I'm proud of the coalition that is there. This is a -- these are people 
that have -- the gut leaders have made the decision to put people in harm's way 
for the good of the world. And we appreciate that sacrifice in America. We 
appreciate that commitment.I think -- one of the things you're seeing is more involvement by the United 
Nations, in terms of the political process. That's helpful. I'd like to get 
another U.N. Security Council resolution out that will help other nations to 
decide to participate.One of the things I've found, John, is that in calling around -- particularly 
during this week, I spoke to Prime Minister Berlusconi and President Kwasniewski 
-- there is a resolve by these leaders that is a heartening resolve. Tony Blair 
is the same way -- he understands, like I understand, that we cannot yield at 
this point in time; that we must remain steadfast and strong; that it's the 
intentions of the enemy to shake our will. That's what they want to do -- they 
want us to leave. And we're not going to leave. We're going to do the job. And a 
free Iraq is going to be a major blow for terrorism. It will change the world. A 
free Iraq in the midst of the Middle East is vital to future peace and security.Maybe I can best put it this way, why I feel so strongly about this historic 
moment. I was having dinner with Prime Minister Koizumi, and we were talking 
about North Korea, about how we can work together to deal with the threat. The 
North Korea leader is a threat. And here are two friends now discussing what 
strategy to employ to prevent him from further developing and deploying a 
nuclear weapon. And it dawned on me that had we blown the peace in World War II, 
that perhaps this conversation would not have been taking place. It also dawned 
on me then that when we get it right in Iraq, at some point in time an American 
President will be sitting down with a duly-elected Iraqi leader talking about 
how to bring security to what has been a troubled part of the world.The legacy that our troops are going to leave behind is a legacy of lasting 
importance, as far as I'm concerned. It's a legacy that really is based upon our 
deep belief that people want to be free and that free societies are peaceful 
societies.Some of the debate really center around the fact that people don't believe 
Iraq can be free; that if you're Muslim, or perhaps brown-skinned, you can't be 
self-governing and free. I strongly disagree with that. I reject that, because I 
believe that freedom is the deepest need of every human soul, and, if given a 
chance, the Iraqi people will be not only self-governing, but a stable and free 
society.Let's see here, hold on. Michael. You're next.Question:Mr. President, why are you and the Vice President insisting on appearing 
together before the 9/11 Commission? And, Mr. President, who will you be handing 
the Iraqi government over to on June 30th?President 
Bush:We will find that out soon. That's what Mr. Brahimi is doing; 
he's figuring out the nature of the entity we'll be handing sovereignty over. 
And, secondly, because the 9/11 Commission wants to ask us questions, that's why 
we're meeting. And I look forward to meeting with them and answering their 
questions.Question:I was asking why you're appearing together, rather than separately, which 
was their request.President 
Bush:Because it's a good chance for both of us to answer questions 
that the 9/11 Commission is looking forward to asking us, and I'm looking 
forward to answering them.Let's see --Question:Mr. President --President 
Bush:Hold on for a minute. Oh, Jim.Question:Thank you, Mr. President.President 
Bush:I've got some ""must calls,"" I'm sorry.Question:You have been accused of letting the 9/11 threat mature too far, but not 
letting the Iraq threat mature far enough. First, could you respond to that 
general criticism? And, secondly, in the wake of these two conflicts, what is 
the appropriate threat level to justify action in perhaps other situations going 
forward?President 
Bush:I guess there have been some that said, well, we should have 
taken preemptive action in Afghanistan, and then turned around and said we 
shouldn't have taken preemptive action in Iraq. And my answer to that question 
is, is that, again I repeat what I said earlier -- prior to 9/11 the country 
really wasn't on a war footing. And the, frankly, mood of the world would have 
been astounded had the United States acted unilaterally in trying to deal with 
al Qaeda in that part of the world.It would have been awfully hard to do, as well, by the way -- we would have 
had to -- we hadn't got our relationship right with Pakistan yet. The Caucus 
area would have been very difficult from which to base. It just seemed an 
impractical strategy at the time, and frankly, I didn't contemplate it.I did contemplate a larger strategy as to how to deal with al Qaeda. We were 
shooting Cruise missiles, and with little effect. And I said, if we're going to 
go after al Qaeda, let's have a comprehensive strategy as to how to deal with 
it, with that entity.After 9/11, the world changed for me, and I think changed for the country. It 
changed for me because, like many, we assumed oceans would protect us from harm, 
and that's not the case, it's not the reality of the 21st century. Oceans don't 
protect us. They don't protect us from killers. We're an open country, and we're 
a country that values our openness. And we're a hard country to defend. And, 
therefore, when we see threats overseas, we've got to take them -- look at them 
in a new light. And I've given my explanation of Iraq.Your further question was, how do you justify any other preemptive action. 
The American people need to know my last choice is the use of military power. It 
is something that -- it is a decision that -- it's a tough decision to make for 
any President, because I fully understand the consequences of the decision. And, 
therefore, we'll use all other means necessary, when we see a threat, to deal 
with a threat that may materialize, but we'll never take the military off the 
table.We've had some success, Bill, as a result of the decision I took. Take Libya, 
for example. Libya was a nation that had -- we viewed as a terrorist -- a nation 
that sponsored terror, a nation that was dangerous because of weapons. And 
Colonel Gadhafi made the decision, and rightly so, to disclose and disarm, for 
the good of the world. By the way, they found, I think, 50 tons of mustard gas, 
I believe it was, in a turkey farm, only because he was willing to disclose 
where the mustard gas was.But that made the world safer. The A.Q. Khan bust, the network that we 
uncovered, thanks to the hard work of our intelligence-gathering agencies and 
the cooperation of the British, was another victory in the war against terror. 
This was a shadowy network of folks that were willing to sell state secrets to 
the highest bidder. And that, therefore, made the world more unstable and more 
dangerous. You've often heard me talk about my worry about weapons of mass 
destruction ending up in the hands of the wrong people. Well, you can understand 
why I feel that way, having seen the works of A.Q. Khan. It's a dangerous -- it 
was a dangerous network that we unraveled. And the world is better for it.And so what I'm telling you is, is that sometimes we use military as a last 
resort, but other times we use our influence, diplomatic pressure, and our 
alliances, to unravel, uncover, expose people who want to do harm against the 
civilized world. We're at war. Iraq is a part of the war on terror. It is not 
the war on terror; it is a theater in the war on terror. And it's essential we 
win this battle in the war on terror. By winning this battle, it will make other 
victories more certain in the war against the terrorists.Let's see here. Judy.Question:Thank you, Mr. President. Sir, you've made it very clear tonight that 
you're committed to continuing the mission in Iraq. Yet, as Terry pointed out, 
increasing numbers of Americans have qualms about it. And this is an election 
year. Will it have been worth it, even if you lose your job because of it?President 
Bush:I don't plan on losing my job. I plan on telling the American 
people that I've got a plan to win the war on terror. And I believe they'll stay 
with me. They understand the stakes. Look, nobody likes to see dead people on 
their television screens -- I don't. It's a tough time for the American people 
to see that. It's gut-wrenching. One of my hardest parts of my job is to console 
the family members who have lost their life. It is a -- it is -- it's a chance 
to hug and weep and to console and to remind the loved ones that the sacrifice 
of their loved one was done in the name of security for America and freedom for 
the world.And one of the things that's very important, Judy, as far as I'm concerned, 
is to never allow our youngsters to die in vain. And I made that pledge to their 
parents. Withdrawing from the battlefield of Iraq would be just that. And it's 
not going to happen under my watch.The American people may decide to change -- that's democracy. I don't think 
so, I don't think so. And I look forward to making my case. I'm looking forward 
to the campaign. Now is the time to talk about winning this war on terror. Now 
is the time to make sure that the American people understand the stakes and the 
historic significance of what we're doing. And no matter where they may stand on 
this war, the thing I appreciate most about our country is the strong support 
given to the men and women in uniform. And it's vital support. It's important 
for those soldiers to know America stands with them. And we weep when they die, 
and we're proud of the victories they achieve.One of the things I'm also proud of is what I hear from our soldiers. As I 
mentioned, I pinned the Purple Heart on some of the troops at the hospital there 
at Fort Hood, Texas. A guy looks at me and says, I can't wait to get back to my 
unit and fulfill the mission, Mr. President. The spirit is incredible. Our 
soldiers who have volunteered to go there understand the stakes. And I'm 
incredibly proud of them.John.Question:Thank you, Mr. President. In the last campaign, you were asked a question 
about the biggest mistake you'd made in your life, and you used to like to joke 
that it was trading Sammy Sosa. You've looked back before 9/11 for what mistakes 
might have been made. After 9/11, what would your biggest mistake be, would you 
say, and what lessons have you learned from it?President 
Bush:I wish you would have given me this written question ahead of 
time, so I could plan for it. John, I'm sure historians will look 
back and say, gosh, he could have done it better this way, or that way. You 
know, I just -- I'm sure something will pop into my head here in the midst of 
this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to come up with an 
answer, but it hadn't yet.I would have gone into Afghanistan the way we went into Afghanistan. Even 
knowing what I know today about the stockpiles of weapons, I still would have 
called upon the world to deal with Saddam Hussein. See, I happen to believe that 
we'll find out the truth on the weapons. That's why we've sent up the 
independent commission. I look forward to hearing the truth, exactly where they 
are. They could still be there. They could be hidden, like the 50 tons of 
mustard gas in a turkey farm.One of the things that Charlie Duelfer talked about was that he was surprised 
at the level of intimidation he found amongst people who should know about 
weapons, and their fear of talking about them because they don't want to be 
killed. There's a terror still in the soul of some of the people in Iraq; 
they're worried about getting killed, and, therefore, they're not going to talk.But it will all settle out, John. We'll find out the truth about the weapons 
at some point in time. However, the fact that he had the capacity to make them 
bothers me today, just like it would have bothered me then. He's a dangerous 
man. He's a man who actually -- not only had weapons of mass destruction -- the 
reason I can say that with certainty is because he used them. And I have no 
doubt in my mind that he would like to have inflicted harm, or paid people to 
inflict harm, or trained people to inflict harm on America, because he hated us.I hope I -- I don't want to sound like I've made no mistakes. I'm confident I 
have. I just haven't -- you just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not 
as quick on my feet as I should be in coming up with one.Yes, Ann.Question:Looking forward about keeping the United States safe -- a group 
representing about several thousand FBI agents today wrote to your 
administration begging you not to split up the law enforcement and the 
counterterrorism, because they say it ties their hands, it's blinders -- yet, 
you mentioned yesterday that you think perhaps the time has come for some real 
intelligence reforms. That can't happen without real leadership from the White 
House. Will you, and how will you?President 
Bush:Well, you're talking about one aspect of possible -- I think 
you're referring to what they call the MI-5. And I heard a summary of that from 
Director Mueller, who feels strongly that we -- and he'll testify to that 
effect, I guess, tomorrow, I shouldn't be prejudging his testimony. But what -- 
my point was is that I'm open for suggestions. I look forward to seeing what the 
9/11 Commission comes up with; I look forward to seeing what the Silberman/Robb 
Commission comes up with. I'm confident Congress will have some suggestions. 
What I'm saying is, let the discussions begin. And I won't prejudge the 
conclusion. As the President, I will encourage and foster these kinds of 
discussions, because one of the jobs of the President is to leave behind a 
legacy that will enable other Presidents to better deal with the threat that we 
face.We are in a long war. The war on terror is not going to end immediately. This 
is a war against people who have no guilt in killing innocent people. That's 
what they're willing to do. They kill on a moment's notice because they're 
trying to shake our will, they're trying to create fear, they're trying to 
affect people's behaviors. And we're simply not going to let them do that.And my fear, of course, is that this will go on for a while -- and, 
therefore, it's incumbent upon us to learn from lessons or mistakes, and leave 
behind a better foundation for Presidents to deal with the threats we face. This 
is the war that other Presidents will be facing as we head into the 21st 
century.One of the interesting things people ask me, now that we're asking questions, 
is, can you ever win the war on terror? Of course, you can. That's why it's 
important for us to spread freedom throughout the Middle East. Free societies 
are hopeful societies. A hopeful society is one more likely to be able to deal 
with the frustrations of those who are willing to commit suicide in order to 
represent a false ideology. A free society is a society in which somebody is 
more likely to be able to make a living. A free society is a society in which 
someone is more likely to be able to raise their child in a comfortable 
environment, and see to it that that child gets an education.That's why I'm pressing the Greater Middle East Reform Initiative, to work to 
spread freedom. And we will continue on that. So long as I'm the President, I 
will press for freedom. I believe so strongly in the power of freedom.You know why I do? Because I've seen freedom work right here in our own 
country. I also have this belief, strong belief, that freedom is not this 
country's gift to the world; freedom is the Almighty's gift to every man and 
woman in this world. And as the greatest power on the face of the Earth, we have 
an obligation to help the spread of freedom. We have an obligation to help feed 
the hungry. I think the American people find it interesting that we're providing 
food for the North Korea people who starve. We have an obligation to lead the 
fight on AIDS, on Africa. And we have an obligation to work toward a more free 
world. That's our obligation. That is what we have been called to do, as far as 
I'm concerned.And my job as the President is to lead this nation into making the world a 
better place. And that's exactly what we're doing. Weeks such as we've had in 
Iraq make some doubt whether or not we're making progress. I understand that. It 
was a tough, tough period. But we are making progress.And my message today to those in Iraq is: We'll stay the course; we'll 
complete the job. My message to our troops is: We will stay the course and 
complete the job and you'll have what you need. And my message to the loved ones 
who are worried about their sons, daughters, husbands, wives, is: You're loved 
one is performing a noble service for the cause of freedom and peace.Let's see, last question here. Hold on for a second. Those who yell will not 
be asked. I'll tell you a guy who I've never heard from -- Don.Question:I appreciate it.President 
Bush:It's a well-received --Question:Following on both Judy's and John's questions, and it comes out of what you 
just said in some ways, with public support for your policies in Iraq falling 
off the way they have -- quite significantly over the past couple of months -- I 
guess I'd like to know if you feel in any way that you've failed as a 
communicator on this topic? Because --President 
Bush:Gosh, I don't know. I mean --Question:Well, you deliver a lot of speeches and a lot of them contain similar 
phrases, and they vary very little from one to the next. And they often include 
a pretty upbeat assessment of how things are going -- with the exception of 
tonight's pretty somber assessment, this evening.President 
Bush:It's a pretty somber assessment today, Don, yes.Question:I guess I just wonder if you feel that you have failed in any way? You 
don't have many of these press conferences, where you engage in this kind of 
exchange. Have you failed in any way to really make the case to the American 
public?President 
Bush:I guess if you put it into a political context, that's the 
kind of thing the voters will decide next November. That's what elections are 
about. They'll take a look at me and my opponent and say, let's see, which one 
of them can better win the war on terror? Who best can see to it that Iraq 
emerges as a free society?Don, if I tried to fine-tune my messages based upon polls, I think I'd be 
pretty ineffective. I know I would be disappointed in myself. I hope today 
you've got a sense of my conviction about what we're doing. If you don't, maybe 
I need to learn to communicate better.I feel strongly about what we're doing. I feel strongly that the course this 
administration has taken will make America more secure and the world more free, 
and, therefore, the world more peaceful. It's a conviction that's deep in my 
soul. And I will say it as best as I possibly can to the American people.I look forward to the debate and the campaign. I look forward to helping -- 
for the American people to hear, what is a proper use of American power; do we 
have an obligation to lead, or should we shirk responsibility. That's how I view 
this debate. And I look forward to making it, Don. I'll do it the best I 
possibly can. I'll give it the best shot. I'll speak as plainly as I can.One thing is for certain, though, about me -- and the world has learned this 
-- when I say something, I mean it. And the credibility of the United States is 
incredibly important for keeping world peace and freedom.Thank you all very much.",eorge bush prime time press conference iraq war time press conference iraq wardelivered april east room white

Army War College, Carlisle, PAAudio mp3 of AddressYour browser does not support the audio element.Thank you 
and good evening. I'm honored to visit the Army War College. Generations of 
officers have come here to study the strategies and history of warfare. I've 
come here tonight to report to all Americans, and to the Iraqi people, on the 
strategy our nation is pursuing in Iraq, and the specific steps were taking to 
achieve our goals.The actions of our enemies 
over the last few weeks have been brutal, calculating, and instructive. We've 
seen a car bombing take the life of a 61-year-old Iraqi named Izzedin Saleem, 
who was serving as President of the Governing Council. This crime shows our 
enemy's intention to prevent Iraqi self-government, even if that means killing a 
lifelong Iraqi patriot and a faithful Muslim. Mr. Saleem was assassinated by 
terrorists seeking the return of tyranny and the death of democracy.We've also seen images of 
a young American facing decapitation. This vile display shows a contempt for all 
the rules of warfare, and all the bounds of civilized behavior. It reveals a 
fanaticism that was not caused by any action of ours, and would not be appeased 
by any concession. We suspect that the man with the knife was an al Qaeda 
associate namedZarqawi. He and other terrorists know that Iraq is now the 
central front in the war on terror. And we must understand that, as well. The 
return of tyranny to Iraq would be an unprecedented terrorist victory, and a 
cause for killers to rejoice. It would also embolden the terrorists, leading to 
more bombings, more beheadings, and more murders of the innocent around the 
world.The rise of a free and 
self-governing Iraq will deny terrorists a base of operation, discredit their 
narrow ideology, and give momentum to reformers across the region. This will be 
a decisive blow to terrorism at the heart of its power, and a victory for the 
security of America and the civilized world.Our work in Iraq has been 
hard. Our coalition has faced changing conditions of war, and that has required 
perseverance, sacrifice, and an ability to adapt. The swift removal of Saddam 
Hussein's regime last spring had an unintended effect: Instead of being killed 
or captured on the battlefield, some of Saddam's elite guards shed their 
uniforms and melted into the civilian population. These elements of Saddam's 
repressive regime and secret police have reorganized, rearmed, and adopted 
sophisticated terrorist tactics. They've linked up with foreign fighters and 
terrorists. In a few cities, extremists have tried to sow chaos and seize 
regional power for themselves. These groups and individuals have conflicting 
ambitions, but they share a goal: They hope to wear out the patience of 
Americans, our coalition, and Iraqis before the arrival of effective 
self-government, and before Iraqis have the capability to defend their freedom.Iraq now faces a critical 
moment. As the Iraqi people move closer to governing themselves, the terrorists 
are likely to become more active and more brutal. There are difficult days 
ahead, and the way forward may sometimes appear chaotic. Yet our coalition is 
strong, our efforts are focused and unrelenting, and no power of the enemy will 
stop Iraq's progress.Helping construct a stable 
democracy after decades of dictatorship is a massive undertaking. Yet we have a 
great advantage. Whenever people are given a choice in the matter, they prefer 
lives of freedom to lives of fear. Our enemies in Iraq are good at filling 
hospitals, but they do not build any. They can incite men to murder and suicide, 
but they cannot inspire men to live, and hope, and add to the progress of their 
country. The terrorists' only influence is violence, and their only agenda is 
death.Our agenda, in contrast, 
is freedom and independence, security and prosperity for the Iraqi people. And 
by removing a source of terrorist violence and instability in the Middle East, 
we also make our own country more secure.Our coalition has a clear 
goal, understood by all -- to see the Iraqi people in charge of Iraq for the 
first time in generations. America's task in Iraq is not only to defeat an 
enemy, it is to give strength to a friend - a free, representative government 
that serves its people and fights on their behalf. And the sooner this goal is 
achieved, the sooner our job will be done.There are five steps in 
our plan to help Iraq achieve democracy and freedom. We will hand over authority 
to a sovereign Iraqi government, help establish security, continue rebuilding 
Iraq's infrastructure, encourage more international support, and move toward a 
national election that will bring forward new leaders empowered by the Iraqi 
people.The first of these steps 
will occur next month, when our coalition will transfer full sovereignty to a 
government of Iraqi citizens who will prepare the way for national elections. On 
June 30th, the Coalition Provisional Authority will cease to exist, and will not 
be replaced. The occupation will end, and Iraqis will govern their own affairs. 
America's ambassador to Iraq, John Negroponte, will present his credentials to 
the new president of Iraq. Our embassy in Baghdad will have the same purpose as 
any other American embassy, to assure good relations with a sovereign nation. 
America and other countries will continue to provide technical experts to help 
Iraq's ministries of government, but these ministries will report to Iraq's new 
prime minister.The United Nations Special 
Envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, is now consulting with a broad spectrum of Iraqis to 
determine the composition of this interim government. The special envoy intends 
to put forward the names of interim government officials this week. In addition 
to a president, two vice presidents, and a prime minister, 26 Iraqi ministers 
will oversee government departments, from health to justice to defense. This new 
government will be advised by a national council, which will be chosen in July 
by Iraqis representing their country's diversity. This interim government will 
exercise full sovereignty until national elections are held. America fully 
supports Mr. Brahimi's efforts, and I have instructed the Coalition Provisional 
Authority to assist him in every way possible.In preparation for 
sovereignty, many functions of government have already been transferred. Twelve 
government ministries are currently under the direct control of Iraqis. The 
Ministry of Education, for example, is out of the propaganda business, and is 
now concerned with educating Iraqi children. Under the direction of Dr. Ala'din 
al-Alwan, the Ministry has trained more than 30,000 teachers and supervisors for 
the schools of a new Iraq.All along, some have 
questioned whether the Iraqi people are ready for self-government, or even want 
it. And all along, the Iraqi people have given their answer. In settings where 
Iraqis have met to discuss their country's future, they have endorsed 
representative government. And they are practicing representative government. 
Many of Iraq's cities and towns now have elected town councils or city 
governments - and beyond the violence, a civil society is emerging.The June 30th transfer of 
sovereignty is an essential commitment of our strategy. Iraqis are proud people 
who resent foreign control of their affairs, just as we would. After decades 
under the tyrant, they are also reluctant to trust authority. By keeping our 
promise on June 30th, the coalition will demonstrate that we have no interest in 
occupation. And full sovereignty will give Iraqis a direct interest in the 
success of their own government. Iraqis will know that when they build a school 
or repair a bridge, they're not working for the Coalition Provisional Authority, 
they are working for themselves. And when they patrol the streets of Baghdad, or 
engage radical militias, they will be fighting for their own country.The second step in the 
plan for Iraqi democracy is to help establish the stability and security that 
democracy requires. Coalition forces and the Iraqi people have the same enemies 
-- the terrorists, illegal militia, and Saddam loyalists who stand between the 
Iraqi people and their future as a free nation. Working as allies, we will 
defend Iraq and defeat these enemies.America will provide 
forces and support necessary for achieving these goals. Our commanders had 
estimated that a troop level below 115,000 would be sufficient at this point in 
the conflict. Given the recent increase in violence, we'll maintain our troop 
level at the current 138,000 as long as necessary. This has required extended 
duty for the 1st Armored Division and the 2nd Light Cavalry Regiment -- 20,000 
men and women who were scheduled to leave Iraq in April. Our nation appreciates 
their hard work and sacrifice, and they can know that they will be heading home 
soon. General Abizaid and other commanders in Iraq are constantly assessing the 
level of troops they need to fulfill the mission. If they need more troops, I 
will send them. The mission of our forces in Iraq is demanding and dangerous. 
Our troops are showing exceptional skill and courage. I thank them for their 
sacrifices and their duty.In the city of Fallujah, 
there's been considerable violence by Saddam loyalists and foreign fighters, 
including the murder of four American contractors. American soldiers and Marines 
could have used overwhelming force. Our commanders, however, consulted with 
Iraq's Governing Council and local officials, and determined that massive 
strikes against the enemy would alienate the local population, and increase 
support for the insurgency. So we have pursued a different approach. We're 
making security a shared responsibility in Fallujah. Coalition commanders have 
worked with local leaders to create an all-Iraqi security force, which is now 
patrolling the city. Our soldiers and Marines will continue to disrupt enemy 
attacks on our supply routes, conduct joint patrols with Iraqis to destroy bomb 
factories and safe houses, and kill or capture any enemy.We want Iraqi forces to 
gain experience and confidence in dealing with their country's enemies. We want 
the Iraqi people to know that we trust their growing capabilities, even as we 
help build them. At the same time, Fallujah must cease to be a sanctuary for the 
enemy, and those responsible for terrorism will be held to account.In the cities of Najaf and 
Karbala and Kufa, most of the violence has been incited by a young, radical 
cleric who commands an illegal militia. These enemies have been hiding behind an 
innocent civilian population, storing arms and ammunition in mosques, and 
launching attacks from holy shrines. Our soldiers have treated religious sites 
with respect, while systematically dismantling the illegal militia. We're also 
seeing Iraqis, themselves, take more responsibility for restoring order. In 
recent weeks, Iraqi forces have ejected elements of this militia from the 
governor's office in Najaf. Yesterday, an elite Iraqi unit cleared out a weapons 
cache from a large mosque in Kufa. Respected Shia leaders have called on the 
militia to withdraw from these towns. Ordinary Iraqis have marched in protest 
against the militants.As challenges arise in 
Fallujah, Najaf, and elsewhere, the tactics of our military will be flexible. 
Commanders on the ground will pay close attention to local conditions. And we 
will do all that is necessary -- by measured force or overwhelming force -- to 
achieve a stable Iraq.Iraq's military, police, 
and border forces have begun to take on broader responsibilities. Eventually, 
they must be the primary defenders of Iraqi security, as American and coalition 
forces are withdrawn. And we're helping them to prepare for this role. In some 
cases, the early performance of Iraqi forces fell short. Some refused orders to 
engage the enemy. We've learned from these failures, and we've taken steps to 
correct them. Successful fighting units need a sense of cohesion, so we've 
lengthened and intensified their training. Successful units need to know they 
are fighting for the future of their own country, not for any occupying power, 
so we are ensuring that Iraqi forces serve under an Iraqi chain of command. 
Successful fighting units need the best possible leadership, so we improved the 
vetting and training of Iraqi officers and senior enlisted men.At my direction, and with 
the support of Iraqi authorities, we are accelerating our program to help train 
Iraqis to defend their country. A new team of senior military officers is now 
assessing every unit in Iraq's security forces. I've asked this team to oversee 
the training of a force of 260,000 Iraqi soldiers, police, and other security 
personnel. Five Iraqi army battalions are in the field now, with another eight 
battalions to join them by July the 1st. The eventual goal is an Iraqi army of 
35,000 soldiers in 27 battalions, fully prepared to defend their country.After June 30th, American 
and other forces will still have important duties. American military forces in 
Iraq will operate under American command as a part of a multinational force 
authorized by the United Nations. Iraq's new sovereign government will still 
face enormous security challenges, and our forces will be there to help.The third step in the plan 
for Iraqi democracy is to continue rebuilding that nation's infrastructure, so 
that a free Iraq can quickly gain economic independence and a better quality of 
life. Our coalition has already helped Iraqis to rebuild schools and refurbish 
hospitals and health clinics, repair bridges, upgrade the electrical grid, and 
modernize the communications system. And now a growing private economy is taking 
shape. A new currency has been introduced. Iraq's Governing Council approved a 
new law that opens the country to foreign investment for the first time in 
decades. Iraq has liberalized its trade policy, and today an Iraqi observer 
attends meetings of the World Trade Organization. Iraqi oil production has 
reached more than two million barrels per day, bringing revenues of nearly $6 
billion so far this year, which is being used to help the people of Iraq. And 
thanks in part to our efforts -- to the efforts of former Secretary of State 
James Baker, many of Iraq's largest creditors have pledged to forgive or 
substantially reduce Iraqi debt incurred by the former regime.We're making progress. Yet 
there still is much work to do. Over the decades of Saddam's rule, Iraq's 
infrastructure was allowed to crumble, while money was diverted to palaces, and 
to wars, and to weapons programs. We're urging other nations to contribute to 
Iraqi reconstruction -- and 37 countries and the IMF and the World Bank have so 
far pledged $13.5 billion in aid. America has dedicated more than $20 billion to 
reconstruction and development projects in Iraq. To ensure our money is spent 
wisely and effectively, our new embassy in Iraq will have regional offices in 
several key cities. These offices will work closely with Iraqis at all levels of 
government to help make sure projects are completed on time and on budget.A new Iraq will also need 
a humane, well-supervised prison system. Under the dictator, prisons like Abu 
Ghraib were symbols of death and torture. That same prison became a symbol of 
disgraceful conduct by a few American troops who dishonored our country and 
disregarded our values. America will fund the construction of a modern, maximum 
security prison. When that prison is completed, detainees at Abu Ghraib will be 
relocated. Then, with the approval of the Iraqi government, we will demolish the 
Abu Ghraib prison, as a fitting symbol of Iraq's new beginning.The fourth step in our 
plan is to enlist additional international support for Iraq's transition. At 
every stage, the United States has gone to the United Nations -- to confront 
Saddam Hussein, to promise serious consequences for his actions, and to begin 
Iraqi reconstruction. Today, the United States and Great Britain presented a new 
resolution in the Security Council to help move Iraq toward self-government. 
I've directed Secretary Powell to work with fellow members of the Council to 
endorse the timetable the Iraqis have adopted, to express international support 
for Iraq's interim government, to reaffirm the world's security commitment to 
the Iraqi people, and to encourage other U.N. members to join in the effort. 
Despite past disagreements, most nations have indicated strong support for the 
success of a free Iraq. And I'm confident they will share in the responsibility 
of assuring that success.Next month, at the NATO 
summit in Istanbul, I will thank our 15 NATO allies who together have more than 
17,000 troops on the ground in Iraq. Great Britain and Poland are each leading a 
multinational division that is securing important parts of the country. And 
NATO, itself, is giving helpful intelligence, communications, and logistical 
support to the Polish-led division. At the summit, we will discuss NATO's role 
in helping Iraq build and secure its democracy.The fifth and most 
important step is free, national elections, to be held no later than next 
January. A United Nations team, headed by Carina Perelli, is now in Iraq, 
helping form an independent election commission that will oversee an orderly, 
accurate national election. In that election, the Iraqi people will choose a 
transitional national assembly, the first freely-elected, truly representative 
national governing body in Iraq's history. This assembly will serve as Iraq's 
legislature, and it will choose a transitional government with executive powers. 
The transitional national assembly will also draft a new constitution, which 
will be presented to the Iraqi people in a referendum scheduled for the fall of 
2005. Under this new constitution, Iraq will elect a permanent government by the 
end of next year.In this time of war and 
liberation and rebuilding, American soldiers and civilians on the ground have 
come to know and respect the citizens of Iraq. They're a proud people who hold 
strong and diverse opinions. Yet Iraqis are united in a broad and deep 
conviction: They're determined never again to live at the mercy of a dictator. 
And they believe that a national election will put that dark time behind them. A 
representative government that protects basic rights, elected by Iraqis, is the 
best defense against the return of tyranny -- and that election is coming.Completing the five steps 
to Iraqi elected self-government will not be easy. There's likely to be more 
violence before the transfer of sovereignty, and after the transfer of 
sovereignty. The terrorists and Saddam loyalists would rather see many Iraqis 
die than have any live in freedom. But terrorists will not determine the future 
of Iraq.That nation is moving 
every week toward free elections and a permanent place among free nations. Like 
every nation that has made the journey to democracy, Iraqis will raise up a 
government that reflects their own culture and values. I sent American troops to 
Iraq to defend our security, not to stay as an occupying power. I sent American 
troops to Iraq to make its people free, not to make them American. Iraqis will 
write their own history, and find their own way. As they do, Iraqis can be 
certain, a free Iraq will always have a friend in the United States of America.In the last 32 months, 
history has placed great demands on our country, and events have come quickly. 
Americans have seen the flames of September the 11th, followed battles in the 
mountains of Afghanistan, and learned new terms like ""orange alert"" and ""ricin"" 
and ""dirty bomb."" We've seen killers at work on trains in Madrid, in a bank in 
Istanbul, at a synagogue in Tunis, and at a nightclub in Bali. And now the 
families of our soldiers and civilian workers pray for their sons and daughters 
in Mosul and Karbala and Baghdad.We did not seek this war 
on terror, but this is the world as we find it. We must keep our focus. We must 
do our duty. History is moving, and it will tend toward hope, or tend toward 
tragedy. Our terrorist enemies have a vision that guides and explains all their 
varied acts of murder. They seek to impose Taliban-like rule, country by 
country, across the greater Middle East. They seek the total control of every 
person, and mind, and soul, a harsh society in which women are voiceless and 
brutalized. They seek bases of operation to train more killers and export more 
violence. They commit dramatic acts of murder to shock, frighten and demoralize 
civilized nations, hoping we will retreat from the world and give them free 
rein. They seek weapons of mass destruction, to impose their will through 
blackmail and catastrophic attacks. None of this is the expression of a 
religion. It is a totalitarian political ideology, pursued with consuming zeal, 
and without conscience.Our actions, too, are 
guided by a vision. We believe that freedom can advance and change lives in the 
greater Middle East, as it has advanced and changed lives in Asia, and Latin 
America, and Eastern Europe, and Africa. We believe it is a tragedy of history 
that in the Middle East -- which gave the world great gifts of law and science 
and faith -- so many have been held back by lawless tyranny and fanaticism. We 
believe that when all Middle Eastern peoples are finally allowed to live and 
think and work and worship as free men and women, they will reclaim the 
greatness of their own heritage. And when that day comes, the bitterness and 
burning hatreds that feed terrorism will fade and die away. America and all the 
world will be safer when hope has returned to the Middle East.These two visions -- one 
of tyranny and murder, the other of liberty and life -- clashed in Afghanistan. 
And thanks to brave U.S. and coalition forces and to Afghan patriots, the 
nightmare of the Taliban is over, and that nation is coming to life again. These 
two visions have now met in Iraq, and are contending for the future of that 
country. The failure of freedom would only mark the beginning of peril and 
violence. But, my fellow Americans, we will not fail. We will persevere, and 
defeat this enemy, and hold this hard-won ground for the realm of liberty.May God bless our country.",eorge bush iraq war address army war college step plan democracy iraqdelivered may army war

for pdfThank you all very much. I'm honored 
			to join with President Clinton, President Bush, Senator Dole and 
			other distinguished guests on this day of remembrance and 
			celebration. And, General Kelley, here in the company of the 
			generation that won the war, I proudly accept the World War II 
			Memorial on behalf of the people of the United States of America.Raising up this Memorial took skill 
			and vision and patience. Now the work is done, and it is a fitting 
			tribute, open and expansive, like America; grand and enduring, like 
			the achievements we honor. The years of World War II were a hard, 
			heroic and gallant time in the life of our country. When it mattered 
			most, an entire generation of Americans showed the finest qualities 
			of our nation and of humanity. On this day, in their honor, we will 
			raise the American flag over a monument that will stand as long as 
			America itself.In the history books, the Second 
			World War can appear as a series of crises and conflicts, following 
			an inevitable course -- from Pearl Harbor to the Coast of Normandy 
			to the deck of the Missouri. Yet, on the day the war began, and on 
			many hard days that followed, the outcome was far from certain.There was a time, in the years before 
			the war, when many earnest and educated people believed that 
			democracy was finished. Men who considered themselves learned and 
			civilized came to believe that free institutions must give way to 
			the severe doctrines and stern discipline of a regimented society. 
			Ideas first whispered in the secret councils of a remote empire, or 
			shouted in the beer halls of Munich, became mass movements. And 
			those movements became armies. And those armies moved mercilessly 
			forward -- until the world saw Hitler strutting in Paris, and U.S. 
			Navy ships burning in their own port. Across the world, from a 
			hiding place in Holland to prison camps of Luzon, the captives 
			awaited their liberators.Those liberators would come, but the 
			enterprise would require the commitment and effort of our entire 
			nation. As World War II began, after a decade of economic 
			depression, the United States was not a rich country. Far from being 
			a great power, we had only the 17th largest army in the world. To 
			fight and win on two fronts, Americans had to work and save and 
			ration and sacrifice as never before. War production plants operated 
			shifts around the clock. Across the country, families planted 
			victory gardens -- 20 million of them, producing 40 percent of the 
			nation's vegetables in backyards and on rooftops. Two out of every 
			three citizens put money into war bonds. As Colonel Oveta Culp Hobby 
			said, ""This was a people's war, and everyone was in it.""As life changed in America, so did 
			the way that Americans saw our own country and its place in the 
			world. The bombs at Pearl Harbor destroyed the very idea that 
			America could live in isolation from the plots of aggressive powers. 
			The scenes of the concentration camps, the heaps of bodies and 
			ghostly survivors, confirmed forever America's calling to oppose the 
			ideologies of death.As we defended our ideals, we began 
			to see that America is stronger when those ideals are fully 
			implemented. America gained strength because women labored for 
			victory and factory jobs, cared for the wounded and wore the 
			uniform, themselves. America gained strength because African 
			Americans and Japanese Americans and others fought for their 
			country, which wasn't always fair to them. In time, these 
			contributions became expectations of equality, and the advances for 
			justice in post-war America made us a better country.With all our flaws, Americans at that 
			time had never been more united. And together we began and completed 
			the largest single task in our history. At the height of conflict, 
			America would have ships on every ocean, and armies on five 
			continents. And on the most crucial of days, would move the 
			equivalent of a major city across the English Channel.And all these vast movements of men 
			and armor were directed by one man who could not walk on his own 
			strength. President Roosevelt brought his own advantages to the job. 
			His resolve was stronger than the will of any dictator. His belief 
			in democracy was absolute. He possessed a daring that kept the enemy 
			guessing. He spoke to Americans with an optimism that lightened 
			their task. And one of the saddest days of the war came just as it 
			was ending, when the casualty notice in the morning paper began with 
			the name, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Commander-in-Chief.Across the years, we still know his 
			voice. And from his words, we know that he understood the character 
			of the American people. Dictators and their generals had dismissed 
			Americans as no match for a master race. FDR answered them. In one 
			of his radio addresses, he said, ""We have been described as a nation 
			of weaklings, playboys. Let them tell that to General McArthur and 
			his men. Let them tell that to the boys in the flying fortresses. 
			Let them tell that to the Marines.""In all, more than 16 million 
			Americans would put on the uniform of the soldier, the sailor, the 
			airman, the Marine, the Coast Guardsman or the Merchant Mariner. 
			They came from city streets and prairie towns, from public high 
			schools and West Point. They were a modest bunch, and still are. The 
			ranks were filled with men like Army Private Joe Sakato. In heavy 
			fighting in France, he saw a good friend killed, and charged up a 
			hill determined to shoot the ones who did it. Private Sakato ran 
			straight into enemy fire, killing 12, wounding two, capturing four, 
			and inspiring his whole unit to take the hill and destroy the enemy. 
			Looking back on it 55 years later, Joe Sakato said, ""I'm 
			not a hero. Nowadays they call what I did 'road rage.'""This man's conduct that day gained 
			him the Medal of Honor, one of 464 awarded for actions in World War 
			II. Americans in uniform served bravely, fought fiercely and kept 
			their honor -- even under the worst of conditions. Yet they were not 
			warriors by nature. All they wanted was to finish the job and make 
			it home. One soldier in the 58th Armor Field Artillery was known to 
			have the best-kept rifle in the unit. He told his buddies he had 
			plans for that weapon after the war. He said, ""I want to take it 
			home, cover it in salt, hang it on a wall in my living room so I can 
			watch it rust.""These were the modest sons of a 
			peaceful country, and millions of us are very proud to call them 
			Dad. They gave the best years of their lives to the greatest mission 
			their country ever accepted. They faced the most extreme 
			danger, which took some and spared others, for reasons only known to 
			God. And wherever they advanced or touched ground, they are 
			remembered for their goodness and their decency. A Polish man 
			recalls being marched through the German countryside in the last 
			weeks of the war, when American forces suddenly appeared. He said, 
			""Our two guards ran away. And this soldier with little blonde hair 
			jumps off his tank. 'You're free,' he shouts at us. We started 
			hugging each other, crying and screaming, 'God sent angels down to 
			pick us up out of this hell place.'""Well, our boys weren't exactly 
			angels. They were flesh and blood, with all the limits and fears of 
			flesh and blood. That only makes the achievement more remarkable -- 
			the courage they showed, in a conflict that claimed more than 
			400,000 American lives, leaving so many orphans and widows and Gold 
			Star Mothers.The soldiers' story was best told by 
			the great Ernie Pyle, who shared their lives and died among them. In 
			his book, ""Here Is Your War,"" he described World War II as many 
			veterans now remember it. It is a picture, he wrote, ""of tired and 
			dirty soldiers, who are alive and don't want to die; of long, 
			darkened convoys in the middle of the night; of shocked, silent men 
			wandering back down the hill from battle; of Jeeps and petrol dumps 
			and smelly bedding roles and C-rations; and blown bridges and dead 
			mules and hospital tents and shirt collars greasy-black from months 
			of wearing; and of laughter, too, and anger, and wine, and lovely 
			flowers and constant cussing. All these, it is composed of; and of 
			graves and graves and graves.""On this Memorial Day weekend, the 
			graves will be visited, and decorated with flowers and flags. Men 
			whose step has slowed are thinking of boys they knew when they were 
			boys together. And women who watched the train leave, and the years 
			pass, can still see the handsome face of their young sweetheart. 
			America will not forget them, either.At this place, at this Memorial, we 
			acknowledge a debt of long-standing to an entire generation of 
			Americans: those who died; those who fought and worked and grieved 
			and went on. They saved our country, and thereby saved the liberty 
			of mankind. And now I ask every man and woman who saw and lived 
			World War II -- every member of that generation -- to please rise as 
			you are able, and receive the thanks of our great nation.May God bless you.",sh wwii memorial wwii memorial dedication addressdelivered may require flash audioyour browser support audio pdfthank

for pdfMrs. Reagan, Patti, 
Michael, and Ron; members of the Reagan family; distinguished guests, including 
our Presidents and First Ladies; Reverend Danforth; fellow citizens:We lost Ronald Reagan only 
days ago, but we have missed him for a long time. We have missed his kindly 
presence, that reassuring voice, and the happy ending we had wished for him. It 
has been ten years since he said his own farewell; yet it is still very sad and 
hard to let him go. Ronald Reagan belongs to the ages now, but we preferred it 
when he belonged to us.In a life of good fortune, 
he valued above all the gracious gift of his wife, Nancy. During his career, 
Ronald Reagan passed through a thousand crowded places; but there was only one 
person, he said, who could make him lonely by just leaving the room.America honors you, Nancy, 
for the loyalty and love you gave this man on a wonderful journey, and to that 
journey's end. Today, our whole nation grieves with you and your family.When the sun sets tonight 
off the coast of California, and we lay to rest our 40th President, a great 
American story will close. The second son of Nell and Jack Reagan first knew the 
world as a place of open plains, quiet streets, gas-lit rooms, and carriages 
drawn by horse. If you could go back to the Dixon, Illinois of 1922, you'd find 
a boy of 11 reading adventure stories at the public library, or running with his 
brother, Neil, along Rock River, and coming home to a little house on Hennepin 
Avenue. That town was the kind of place you remember where you prayed side by 
side with your neighbors, and if things were going wrong for them, you prayed 
for them, and knew they'd pray for you if things went wrong for you.The Reagan family would 
see its share of hardship, struggle and uncertainty. And out of that 
circumstance came a young man of steadiness, calm, and a cheerful confidence 
that life would bring good things. The qualities all of us have seen in Ronald 
Reagan were first spotted 70 and 80 years ago. As a lifeguard in Lowell Park, he 
was the protector keeping an eye out for trouble. As a sports announcer on the 
radio, he was the friendly voice that made you see the game as he did. As an 
actor, he was the handsome, all-American, good guy, which, in his case, required 
knowing his lines -- and being himself.Along the way, certain 
convictions were formed and fixed in the man. Ronald Reagan believed that 
everything happened for a reason, and that we should strive to know and do the 
will of God. He believed that the gentleman always does the kindest thing. He 
believed that people were basically good, and had the right to be free. He 
believed that bigotry and prejudice were the worst things a person could be 
guilty of. He believed in the Golden Rule and in the power of prayer. He 
believed that America was not just a place in the world, but the hope of the 
world.And he believed in taking 
a break now and then, because, as he said, there's nothing better for the inside 
of a man than the outside of a horse.Ronald Reagan spent 
decades in the film industry and in politics, fields known, on occasion, to 
change a man. But not this man. From Dixon to Des Moines, to Hollywood to 
Sacramento, to Washington, D.C., all who met him remembered the same sincere, 
honest, upright fellow. Ronald Reagan's deepest beliefs never had much to do 
with fashion or convenience. His convictions were always politely stated, 
affably argued, and as firm and straight as the columns of this cathedral.There came a point in 
Ronald Reagan's film career when people started seeing a future beyond the 
movies. The actor, Robert Cummings, recalled one occasion. ""I was sitting around 
the set with all these people and we were listening to Ronnie, quite absorbed. I 
said, 'Ron, have you ever considered someday becoming President?' He said, 
'President of what?' 'President of the United States,' I said. And he said, 
'What's the matter, don't you like my acting either?'""The clarity and intensity 
of Ronald Reagan's convictions led to speaking engagements around the country, 
and a new following he did not seek or expect. He often began his speeches by 
saying, ""I'm going to talk about controversial things."" And then he spoke of 
communist rulers as slavemasters, of a government in Washington that had far 
overstepped its proper limits, of a time for choosing that was drawing near. In 
the space of a few years, he took ideas and principles that were mainly found in 
journals and books, and turned them into a broad, hopeful movement ready to 
govern.As soon as Ronald Reagan 
became California's governor, observers saw a star in the West -- tanned, 
well-tailored, in command, and on his way. In the 1960s, his friend, Bill 
Buckley, wrote, ""Reagan is indisputably a part of America, and he may become a 
part of American history.""Ronald Reagan's moment 
arrived in 1980. He came out ahead of some very good men, including one from 
Plains, and one from Houston. What followed was one of the decisive decades of 
the century, as the convictions that shaped the President began to shape the 
times.He came to office with 
great hopes for America, and more than hopes -- like the President he had 
revered and once saw in person, Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan matched an 
optimistic temperament with bold, persistent action. President Reagan was 
optimistic about the great promise of economic reform, and he acted to restore 
the reward and spirit of enterprise. He was optimistic that a strong America 
could advance the peace, and he acted to build the strength that mission 
required. He was optimistic that liberty would thrive wherever it was planted, 
and he acted to defend liberty wherever it was threatened.And Ronald Reagan believed 
in the power of truth in the conduct of world affairs. When he saw evil camped 
across the horizon, he called that evil by its name. There were no doubters in 
the prisons and gulags, where dissidents spread the news, tapping to each other 
in code what the American President had dared to say. There were no doubters in 
the shipyards and churches and secret labor meetings, where brave men and women 
began to hear the creaking and rumbling of a collapsing empire. And there were 
no doubters among those who swung hammers at the hated wall as the first and 
hardest blow had been struck by President Ronald Reagan.The ideology he opposed 
throughout his political life insisted that history was moved by impersonal ties 
and unalterable fates. Ronald Reagan believed instead in the courage and triumph 
of free men. And we believe it, all the more, because we saw that courage in 
him.As he showed what a 
President should be, he also showed us what a man should be. Ronald Reagan 
carried himself, even in the most powerful office, with a decency and attention 
to small kindnesses that also defined a good life. He was a courtly, gentle and 
considerate man, never known to slight or embarrass others. Many people across 
the country cherish letters he wrote in his own hand -- to family members on 
important occasions; to old friends dealing with sickness and loss; to strangers 
with questions about his days in Hollywood. A boy once wrote to him requesting 
federal assistance to help clean up his bedroom.The President replied 
that, ""unfortunately, funds are dangerously low."" He continued, ""I'm sure your 
mother was fully justified in proclaiming your room a disaster. Therefore, you 
are in an excellent position to launch another volunteer program in our nation. 
Congratulations.""Sure, our 40th President 
wore his title lightly, and it fit like a white Stetson. In the end, through his 
belief in our country and his love for our country, he became an enduring symbol 
of our country. We think of his steady stride, that tilt of a head and snap of a 
salute, the big-screen smile, and the glint in his Irish eyes when a story came 
to mind.We think of a man 
advancing in years with the sweetness and sincerity of a Scout saying the 
Pledge. We think of that grave expression that sometimes came over his face, the 
seriousness of a man angered by injustice -- and frightened by nothing. We know, 
as he always said, that America's best days are ahead of us, but with Ronald 
Reagan's passing, some very fine days are behind us, and that is worth our 
tears.Americans saw death 
approach Ronald Reagan twice, in a moment of violence, and then in the years of 
departing light. He met both with courage and grace. In these trials, he showed 
how a man so enchanted by life can be at peace with life's end.And where does that 
strength come from? Where is that courage learned? It is the faith of a boy who 
read the Bible with his mom. It is the faith of a man lying in an operating 
room, who prayed for the one who shot him before he prayed for himself. It is 
the faith of a man with a fearful illness, who waited on the Lord to call him 
home.Now, death has done all 
that death can do. And as Ronald Wilson Reagan goes his way, we are left with 
the joyful hope he shared. In his last years, he saw through a glass darkly. Now 
he sees his Savior face to face.And we look to that fine 
day when we will see him again, all weariness gone, clear of mind, strong and 
sure, and smiling again, and the sorrow of his parting gone forever.May God bless Ronald 
Reagan, and the country he loved.",ald reagan american national memorial service ronald reagandelivered june national cathedral washington browser support video require flash audioyour browser support

audio]Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman, delegates, fellow citizens: I'm 
honored by your support, and I accept your nomination for President of the 
United States.When I -- When I said those words four years ago, none of us could have envisioned what 
these years would bring. In the heart of this great city, we saw tragedy arrive 
on a quiet morning. We saw the bravery of rescuers grow with danger. We learned 
of passengers on a doomed plane who died with a courage that frightened their 
killers. We have seen a shaken economy rise to its feet. And we have seen 
Americans in uniform storming mountain strongholds, and charging through 
sandstorms, and liberating millions, with acts of valor that would make the men 
of Normandy proud.Since 2001, Americans have been given hills to climb, and found the strength to 
climb them. Now, because we have made the hard journey, we can see the valley 
below. Now, because we have faced challenges with resolve, we have historic 
goals within our reach, and greatness in our future. We will build a safer world 
and a more hopeful America and nothing will hold us back.In the work we have done, and the work we will do, I am fortunate to have a 
superb Vice President. I have counted on Dick Cheney's calm and steady judgment 
in difficult days, and I'm honored to have him at my side.I am grateful to share my walk in life with Laura Bush. 
Americans -- Americans have come to see the goodness and kindness and strength I first saw 26 
years ago, and we love our First Lady.I'm a fortunate father of two spirited, intelligent, and lovely young women.I'm blessed with a sister and brothers who are my closest friends. And I 
will always be the proud and grateful son of George and Barbara Bush.My father served eight years at the side of another great American: Ronald 
Reagan. His -- His spirit of optimism and goodwill and decency are in this hall, and 
are in 
our hearts, and will always define our Party.Two months from today, voters will make a choice based on the records we have 
built, the convictions we hold, and the vision that guides us forward. A 
presidential election is a contest for the future. Tonight I will tell you where 
I stand, what I believe, and where I will lead this country in the next four 
years.I believe -- I believe every child can learn, and every school must teach, so we passed the 
most important federal education reform in history. Because we acted, children 
are making sustained progress in reading and math, America's schools are getting 
better, and nothing will hold us back.I believe we have a moral responsibility to honor America's seniors, so I 
brought Republicans and Democrats together to strengthen Medicare. Now seniors 
are getting immediate help buying medicine. Soon every senior will be able to 
get prescription drug coverage, and nothing will hold us back.I believe in the energy and innovative spirit of America's workers, 
entrepreneurs, farmers, and ranchers, so we unleashed that energy with the 
largest tax relief in a generation. Because we acted, our economy is growing 
again, and creating jobs, and nothing will hold us back.I believe the most solemn duty of the American president is to protect the 
American people. If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the 
world will drift toward tragedy. This will not happen on my watch.I'm running for President with a clear and positive plan to build a safer 
world, and a more hopeful America. I'm running with a compassionate 
conservative philosophy: that government should help people improve their lives, 
not try to run their lives. I believe this Nation wants steady, consistent, 
principled leadership and that is why, with your help, we will win this 
election.The story -- The story of America is the story of expanding liberty: an ever-widening 
circle, constantly growing to reach further and include more. Our Nation's 
founding commitment is still our deepest commitment: In our world, and here at 
home, we will extend the frontiers of freedom.The times in which we live and work are changing dramatically. The workers of 
our parents' generation typically had one job, one skill, one career often with 
one company that provided health care and a pension. And most of those workers 
were men. Today, workers change jobs, even careers, many times during their 
lives, and in one of the most dramatic shifts our society has seen, two-thirds 
of all Moms also work outside the home.This changed world can be a time of great opportunity for all Americans to earn 
a better living, support your family, and have a rewarding career. And 
government must take your side. Many of our most fundamental systems -- the tax 
code, health coverage, pension plans, worker training -- were created for the 
world of yesterday, not tomorrow. We will transform these systems so that all 
citizens are equipped, prepared, and thus truly free to make your own choices and 
pursue your own dreams.My plan begins with providing the security and opportunity of a growing 
economy. We now compete in a global market that provides new buyers for our 
goods, but new competition for our workers. To create more jobs in America, 
America must be the best place in the world to do business. To create jobs, my 
plan will encourage investment and expansion by restraining federal spending, 
reducing regulation, and making the tax relief permanent. To create jobs, we will 
make our country less dependent on foreign sources of energy. To create jobs, we 
will expand trade and level the playing field to sell American goods and 
services across the globe. And we must protect small business owners and workers 
from the explosion of frivolous lawsuits that threaten jobs across our country.Another drag on our economy is the current tax code, which is a complicated mess 
filled with special interest loopholes, saddling our people with more than six 
billion hours of paperwork and headache every year. The American people deserve 
and our economic future demands a simpler, fairer, pro-growth system. In a new 
term, I will lead a bipartisan effort to reform and simplify the federal tax 
code.Another priority in a new term will be to help workers take advantage of the 
expanding economy to find better and higher-paying jobs. In this time of change, 
many workers want to go back to school to learn different or higher-level 
skills. So we will double the number of people served by our principal job 
training program and increase funding for our community colleges. I know that with 
the right skills, American workers can compete with anyone, anywhere in the 
world.In this time of change, opportunity in some communities is more distant than in 
others. To stand with workers in poor communities and those that have lost 
manufacturing, textile, and other jobs we will create American opportunity 
zones. In these areas, we will provide tax relief and other incentives to attract 
new business, and improve housing and job training to bring hope and work 
throughout all of America.As I've traveled the country, I've met many workers and small business owners 
who have told me that they are worried they cannot afford health care. More than half 
of the uninsured are small business employees and their families. In a new term, 
we must allow small firms to join together to purchase insurance at the 
discounts available to big companies. We will offer a tax credit to encourage 
small businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts, and 
provide -- and provide direct help for low-income Americans to purchase them. These accounts 
give workers the security of insurance against major illness, the opportunity to 
save tax-free for routine health expenses, and the freedom of knowing you can 
take your account with you whenever you change jobs. We will provide 
low-income Americans with better access to health care: In a new term, I will 
ensure every poor county in America has a community or rural health center.As I've traveled our country, I've met too many 
good doctors, especially OBGYNS, 
who are being forced out of practice because of the high cost of lawsuits. To 
make health care more affordable and accessible, we must pass medical liability 
reform now. And in all we do to improve health care in America, we will make 
sure that health decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by bureaucrats 
in Washington, DC.In this time of change, government must take the side of working families. In 
a new term, we will change outdated labor laws to offer comp-time and flex-time. 
Our laws should never stand in the way of a more family-friendly workplace.Another priority for a new term is to build an ownership society, because 
ownership brings security, and dignity, and independence. Thanks to our 
policies, homeownership in America is at an all-time high. Tonight we set a new 
goal: seven million more affordable homes in the next 10 years so more American 
families will be able to open the door and say welcome to my home.In an ownership society, more people will own their health 
care plans, and have the 
confidence of owning a piece of their retirement. We'll always keep the 
promise of Social Security for our older workers. With the huge Baby Boom 
generation approaching retirement, many of our children and grandchildren 
understandably worry whether Social Security will be there when they need it. We 
must strengthen Social Security by allowing younger workers to save some of 
their taxes in a personal -- personal account, a nest egg you can call your own, and 
government can never take away.In all these proposals, we seek to provide not just a government program, but 
a path -- a path to greater opportunity, more freedom, and more control over 
your own life. And the path begins with our youngest Americans. To build a more hopeful America, 
we must help our children reach as far as their vision and character can take 
them. Tonight, I remind every parent and every teacher, I say to every child: No 
matter what your circumstance, no matter where you live, your school will be the 
path to promise of America.We are transforming our schools by raising standards and focusing on results. 
We are insisting on accountability, empowering parents and teachers, and making 
sure that local people are in charge of their schools. By testing every child, 
we are identifying those who need help -- and we are providing a record level of 
funding to get them that help. In northeast Georgia, Gainesville Elementary 
School is mostly Hispanic and 90 percent poor -- and this year 90 percent of its 
students passed state tests in reading and math. The principal -- The principal expresses the 
philosophy of his school this way: ""We don't focus on what we can't do at this 
school; we focus on what we can do. And we do whatever it takes to get kids across 
the finish line."" See, this principal is challenging the soft bigotry of low 
expectations, and that is the spirit of our education reform, and the commitment 
of our country: No dejaremos a ningún niño atrás. ""We will leave no child behind.""We are making progress -- We are making and there is more to do. In this time of change, most new 
jobs are filled by people with at least two years of college, yet only about one 
in four students gets there. In our high schools, we will fund early 
intervention programs to help students at risk. We will place a new focus on 
math and science. As we make progress, we will require a rigorous exam before 
graduation. By raising performance in our high schools, and expanding Pell 
grants for low and middle income families, we will help more Americans start 
their career with a college diploma.America's children must also have a healthy start in life. In a new term, we 
will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are 
eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance programs. We 
will not allow a lack of attention, or information, to stand between these 
children and the health care they need.Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find 
'em online. The web address 
is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember:GeorgeWBush.com.These changing times can be exciting times of expanded opportunity. And here, 
you face a choice. My opponent's policies are dramatically different from ours. 
Senator Kerry opposed Medicare reform and health savings accounts. After 
supporting my education reforms, he now wants to dilute 'em. He opposes legal 
and medical liability reform. He opposed reducing the marriage penalty, opposed 
doubling the child credit, opposed lowering income taxes for all who pay 
them. (Wait a minute. Wait a minute.) To be fair, there are some things my opponent is for. 
He's -- He's proposed more 
than two trillion dollars in federal spending so far, and that's a lot, even 
for a senator from Massachusetts. And to pay for that spending, he is runnin' on a 
platform of increasing taxes, and that's the kind of promise a politician 
usually keeps.His tax and -- His policies of tax and spend, 
of expanding government rather than expanding opportunity are the politics of the past. We are on the path to the future and 
we're not turning back.In this world of change, some things do not change: the values we try to live 
by, the institutions that give our lives meaning and purpose. Our society rests 
on a foundation of responsibility and character and family commitment.Because family and work are sources of stability and dignity, I support welfare 
reform that strengthens family and requires work. Because a caring society will 
value its weakest members, we must make a place for the unborn child. Because 
-- Because religious charities provide a safety net of mercy and compassion, our government 
must never discriminate against them. Because the union of a man and woman 
deserves an honored place in our society, I support the protection of marriage 
against activist judges. And I will continue to appoint federal judges who know 
the difference between personal opinion and the strict interpretation of the 
law.My opponent recently announced that he's the 
conservative -- the candidate of ""conservative 
values."" Must have come as a surprise to a lot of his supporters. There are some problems with this claim. If you say the heart and soul of 
America is found in Hollywood, I'm afraid you are not the candidate of 
conservative values. If -- If you voted against the bipartisan Defense of Marriage 
Act, which President Clinton signed, you are not the candidate of conservative 
values. If you gave a speech, as my opponent did, calling the Reagan presidency 
eight years of ""moral darkness,"" then you may be a lot of things, but the 
candidate of conservative values is not one of them.This election will also determine how America responds to the continuing danger 
of terrorism. And you know where I stand. Three days after September the 11th, I 
stood where Americans died, in the ruins of the Twin Towers. Workers in hard 
hats were shouting to me, ""Whatever it takes."" A fellow grabbed me by the arm 
and he said, ""Do not let me down."" Since that day, I wake up every morning 
thinking about how to better protect our country. I will never relent in 
defending America whatever it takes.So we have fought the terrorists across the earth not for pride, not for 
power, but because the lives of our citizens are at stake. Our strategy is 
clear. We've tripled funding for homeland security and trained a half a million 
first responders, because we're determined to protect our homeland. We're 
transforming our military and reforming and strengthening our intelligence 
services. We are staying on the offensive, striking terrorists abroad, so we do 
not have to face them here at home. And we are working to advance liberty in the 
broader Middle East, because freedom will bring a future of hope, and the peace 
we all want. And we will prevail.Our strategy is succeeding. Four years ago, Afghanistan was the home base of 
al-Qaida; Pakistan was a transit point for terrorist groups; Saudi Arabia was 
fertile ground for terrorist fundraising; Libya was secretly pursuing nucular 
[nuclear] 
weapons; Iraq was a gathering threat; and al-Qaida was largely unchallenged as 
it planned attacks. Today, the government of -- of a free Afghanistan is fighting 
terror; Pakistan is capturing terrorist leaders; Saudi Arabia is making raids 
and arrests; Libya is dismantling its weapons programs; the army of a free Iraq 
is fighting for freedom; and more than three-quarters of al-Qaida's key members 
and associates have been detained or killed. We have led; many have joined; and 
America and the world are safer.This progress involved careful diplomacy, clear moral purpose, and some tough 
decisions. And the toughest came on Iraq. We knew Saddam Hussein's record of 
aggression and support for terror. We knew his long history of pursuing, even 
using, weapons of mass destruction. And we know that September the 11th requires our 
country to think differently: We must, and we will, confront threats to America 
before it is too late.In Saddam Hussein, we saw a threat. Members of both political parties, including 
--. Members of both political parties, including my opponent and his running mate, saw the threat, and voted to authorize the use 
of force. We went to the United Nations Security Council, which passed a 
unanimous resolution demanding the dictator disarm, or face serious 
consequences. Leaders in the Middle East urged him to comply. After more than a 
decade of diplomacy, we gave Saddam Hussein another chance, a final chance, to 
meet his responsibilities to the civilized world. He again refused, and I faced 
the kind of decision that comes only to the Oval Office, a decision no president 
would ask for, but must be prepared to make. Do I forget the lessons of 
September the 11th and take the word of a madman, or do I take action to defend our 
country? Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time.Because we acted to defend our country, the murderous regimes of Saddam 
Hussein and the Taliban are history, more than 50 million people have been 
liberated, and democracy is coming to the broader Middle East. In Afghanistan, 
terrorists have done everything they can to intimidate people, yet more than 10 
million citizens have registered to vote in the October presidential election -- 
a resounding endorsement for democracy. Despite ongoing acts of violence, Iraq 
now has a strong Prime Minister, a national council, and national elections are 
scheduled for January. Our Nation is standing with the people of Afghanistan and 
Iraq, because when America gives its word, America must keep its word.As 
importantly, we are serving a vital and historic cause that will make our 
country safer. Free societies in the Middle East will be hopeful societies, 
which no longer feed resentments and breed violence for export. Free governments 
in the Middle East will fight terrorists instead of harboring them, and that 
helps us keep the peace. So our mission in Afghanistan and Iraq is clear: We 
will help new leaders to train their armies, and move toward elections, and get 
on the path of stability and democracy as quickly as possible. And then our 
troops will return home with the honor they have earned.Our troops know the historic importance of our work. One Army Specialist wrote 
home: ""We are transforming a once sick society into a hopeful place. The various 
terrorist enemies we are facing in Iraq,"" he continued, ""are really aiming at 
you back in the United States. This is a test of will for our country. We 
soldiers of yours are doing great and scoring victories in confronting the evil 
terrorists.""
That young man is right -- our men and women in uniform are doing a superb 
job for America.Tonight I want to speak to all of them and to their families: 
You are involved in a struggle of historic proportion. Because of your service 
and sacrifice, we are defeating the terrorists where they live and plan, and 
you're making America safer. Because of you, women in Afghanistan are no longer shot in 
a sports stadium. Because of you, the people of Iraq no longer fear being 
executed and left in mass graves. Because of you, the world is more just and 
will be more peaceful. We owe you our thanks, and we owe you something more. We 
will give you all the resources, all the tools, and all the support you need for 
victory.Again -- Again my opponent and I have different approaches. I proposed, and the Congress 
overwhelmingly passed, 87 billion dollars in funding needed by our troops doing 
battle in Afghanistan and Iraq. My opponent and his running mate voted against 
this money for bullets, and fuel, and vehicles, and body armor. When asked to 
explain his vote, the Senator said, ""I actually did vote for the 87 billion 
dollars before I voted against it."" Then he said -- Then he said he was ""proud"" of 
his vote. 
Then, when pressed, he said it was a ""complicated"" matter. There's nothing 
complicated about supporting our troops in combat.Our allies also know the historic importance of our work. About 40 nations 
stand beside us in Afghanistan, and some 30 in Iraq. I deeply appreciate the 
courage and wise counsel of leaders like Prime Minister Howard, President 
Kwasniewski, Prime Minister Berlusconi and, of course, Prime Minister Tony 
Blair.Again, my opponent takes a different approach. In the midst of war, he has 
called American allies, quote, a ""coalition of the coerced and the bribed."" 
That would be nations like Great Britain, Poland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, 
Denmark, El Salvador, Australia, and others -- allies that deserve the respect 
of all Americans, not the scorn of a politician.I respect every soldier, from 
every country, who serves beside us in the hard work of history. America is 
grateful, and America will not forget.The people we have freed won't forget either. Not long ago, seven Iraqi men 
came to see me in the Oval Office. They had ""X""s branded into their foreheads, 
and their right hands had been cut off by Saddam Hussein's secret police, the 
sadistic punishment for imaginary crimes. During our emotional visit one of the 
Iraqi men used his new prosthetic hand to slowly write out, in Arabic, a prayer 
for God to bless America. I am proud that our country remains the hope of the 
oppressed, and the greatest force for good on this earth.Others understand the historic importance of our work. The terrorists know. 
They know that a vibrant, successful democracy at the heart of the Middle East 
will discredit their radical ideology of hate. They know that men and women with 
hope and purpose and dignity do not strap bombs on their bodies and kill the 
innocent. The terrorists are fighting freedom with all their cunning and cruelty 
because freedom is their greatest fear, and they should be afraid, because 
freedom is on the march.I believe in the transformational power of liberty: The wisest use of American 
strength is to advance freedom. As the citizens of Afghanistan and Iraq seize 
the moment, their example will send a message of hope throughout a vital region. 
Palestinians will hear the message that democracy and reform are within their 
reach, and so is peace with our good friend Israel. Young women across the 
Middle East will hear the message that their day of equality and justice is 
coming. Young men will hear the message that national progress and dignity are 
found in liberty, not tyranny and terror. Reformers and political prisoners 
and exiles will hear the message that their dream of freedom cannot be denied 
forever. And as freedom advances heart by heart, and nation by nation America 
will be more secure and the world more peaceful.America has done this kind of work before and there have always been 
doubters. In 1946, 18 months after the fall of Berlin to allied forces, a 
journalist in the New York Times wrote this:""Germany is a land in an acute stage of 
economic, political and moral crisis. European capitals are frightened. In 
every military headquarters, one meets alarmed officials doing their utmost to 
deal with the consequences of the occupation policy that they admit has failed.""End quote. Maybe that same person is still around, writing editorials. 
Fortunately, we had a resolute president named Truman, who, with the American 
people, persevered -- knowing that a new democracy at the center of Europe would 
lead to stability and peace. And because that generation of Americans held firm 
in the cause of liberty, we live in a better and safer world today.The progress we and our friends and allies seek in the broader Middle East will 
not come easily, or all at once. Yet Americans, of all people, should never be 
surprised by the power of liberty to transform lives and nations.That power 
brought settlers on perilous journeys, inspired colonies to rebellion, ended the 
sin of slavery, and set our Nation against the tyrannies of the 20th century. We 
were honored to aid the rise of democracy in Germany and Japan, Nicaragua, 
Central Europe and the Baltics. And that noble story goes on.I believe that 
America is called to lead the cause of freedom in a new century.I believe that 
millions in the Middle East plead in silence for their liberty.I believe that 
given the chance, they will embrace the most honorable form of government ever 
devised by man.I believe all these things because freedom is not America's gift 
to the world, it is the Almighty God's gift to every man and woman in this 
world.This moment in the life of our country will be remembered. Generations will 
know if we kept our faith and kept our word. Generations will know if we seized 
this moment and used it to build a future of safety and peace. The freedom of 
many, and the future security of our Nation, now depend on us. And tonight, my 
fellow Americans, I ask you to stand with me.In the last four years -- In the last four 
years, you and I have come to know each other. Even when we 
don't agree, at least you know what I believe and where I stand.You may have 
noticed I have a few flaws, too. People sometimes have to correct my English. I 
knew I had a problem when Arnold Schwarzenegger started doing it. Some folks 
look at me and see a certain swagger, which in Texas is called ""walking."" Now 
and then I come across as a little too blunt and for that we can all thank the 
white-haired lady sitting right up there.One thing I have learned about the presidency 
is that whatever shortcomings you have, people are going to notice them and 
whatever strengths you have, you're gonna need 'em. These four years have brought moments I could not 
foresee and will not forget. I've tried to comfort Americans who lost the most 
on September the 11th -- people who showed me a picture or told me a story, so I'd 
-- I 
would know how much was taken from them. I've learned first-hand that ordering 
Americans into battle is the hardest decision, even when it is right. I have 
returned the salute of wounded soldiers, some with a very tough road ahead, who 
say they were just doing their job. I've held the children of the fallen, who 
were told their dad or mom is a hero, but would rather just have their mom or dad.I've met with the parents and wives and husbands who have received a folded 
flag, and said a final goodbye to a soldier they loved. I am awed that so many 
have used those meetings to say that I'm in their prayers -- and to offer 
encouragement to me. Where does that strength like that come from? How can people so 
burdened with sorrow also feel such pride? It is because they know their loved 
one was last seen doing good. Because they know that liberty was precious to the 
one they lost. And in those military families, I have seen the character of a 
great nation: decent, idealistic, and strong.The world saw that spirit three miles from here, when the people of this city 
faced peril together, and lifted a flag over the ruins, and defied the enemy 
with their courage.My fellow Americans, for as long as our country stands, 
people will look to the resurrection of New York City and they will say: Here 
buildings fell; here a nation rose.We see America's character in our military, which finds a way or makes one.We 
see it in our veterans, who are supporting military families in their days of 
worry.We see it in our young people, who have found heroes once again.We see 
that character in workers and entrepreneurs, who are renewing our economy with 
their effort and optimism.And all of this has confirmed one belief beyond 
doubt: Having come this far, our tested and confident Nation can achieve 
anything.To everything we know there is a season -- a time for sadness, a time for 
struggle, a time for rebuilding. And now we have reached a time for hope.This 
young century will be liberty's century. By promoting liberty abroad, we will 
build a safer world. By encouraging liberty at home, we will build a more 
hopeful America. Like generations before us, we have a calling from beyond the 
stars to stand for freedom. This is the everlasting dream of America and 
tonight, in this place, that dream is renewed.Now we go forward grateful for 
our freedom, faithful to our cause, and confident in the future of the greatest 
nation on earth.God bless you, and may God continue to bless 
our great country.Thank you all.",n national convention republican national convention addressdelivered september madison square garden new yorkaudio require flash audioyour browser support audio pdf

for pdfMr. Secretary General, Mr. President, distinguished delegates, ladies 
		and gentlemen:Thank you for the honor of addressing this General 
		Assembly. The American people respect the idealism that gave life to 
		this organization. And we respect the men and women of the U.N., who 
		stand for peace and human rights in every part of the world. Welcome to 
		New York City, and welcome to the United States of America.During the past three years, I've addressed this General Assembly in atime of tragedy for my country, and in times of decision for all of us. 
		Now we gather at a time of tremendous opportunity for the U.N. and for 
		all peaceful nations. For decades, the circle of liberty and security 
		and development has been expanding in our world. This progress has 
		brought unity to Europe, self-government to Latin America and Asia, and 
		new hope to Africa. Now we have the historic chance to widen the circle 
		even further, to fight radicalism and terror with justice and dignity, 
		to achieve a true peace, founded on human freedom.The United Nations and my country share the deepest commitments. Both 
		the American Declaration of Independence and the Universal Declaration 
		of Human Rights proclaim the equal value and dignity of every human 
		life. That dignity is honored by the rule of law, limits on the power of 
		the state, respect for women, protection of private property, free 
		speech, equal justice, and religious tolerance. That dignity is 
		dishonored by oppression, corruption, tyranny, bigotry, terrorism and 
		all violence against the innocent. And both of our founding documents 
		affirm that this bright line between justice and injustice -- between 
		right and wrong -- is the same in every age, and every culture, and 
		every nation.Wise governments also stand for these principles for very practical and 
		realistic reasons. We know that dictators are quick to choose 
		aggression, while free nations strive to resolve differences in peace. 
		We know that oppressive governments support terror, while free 
		governments fight the terrorists in their midst. We know that free 
		peoples embrace progress and life, instead of becoming the recruits for 
		murderous ideologies.Every nation that wants peace will share the benefits of a freer world. 
		And every nation that seeks peace has an obligation to help build that 
		world. Eventually, there is no safe isolation from terror networks, or 
		failed states that shelter them, or outlaw regimes, or weapons of mass 
		destruction. Eventually, there is no safety in looking away, seeking the 
		quiet life by ignoring the struggles and oppression of others.In this young century, our world needs a new definition of security. Our 
		security is not merely found in spheres of influence, or some balance of 
		power. The security of our world is found in the advancing rights of 
		mankind.These rights are advancing across the world -- and across the world, the 
		enemies of human rights are responding with violence. Terrorists and 
		their allies believe the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
		American Bill of Rights, and every charter of liberty ever written, are 
		lies, to be burned and destroyed and forgotten. They believe that 
		dictators should control every mind and tongue in the Middle East and 
		beyond. They believe that suicide and torture and murder are fully 
		justified to serve any goal they declare. And they act on their beliefs.In the last year alone, terrorists have attacked police stations, and 
		banks, and commuter trains, and synagogues -- and a school filled with 
		children. This month in Beslan we saw, once again, how the terrorists 
		measure their success -- in the death of the innocent, and in the pain 
		of grieving families. Svetlana Dzebisov was held hostage, along with her 
		son and her nephew -- her nephew did not survive. She recently visited 
		the cemetery, and saw what she called the ""little graves."" She said, ""I 
		understand that there is evil in the world. But what have these little 
		creatures done?""Members of the United Nations, the Russian children did nothing to 
		deserve such awful suffering, and fright, and death. The people of 
		Madrid and Jerusalem and Istanbul and Baghdad have done nothing to 
		deserve sudden and random murder. These acts violate the standards of 
		justice in all cultures, and the principles of all religions. All 
		civilized nations are in this struggle together, and all must fight the 
		murderers.We're determined to destroy terror networks wherever they operate, and 
		the United States is grateful to every nation that is helping to seize 
		terrorist assets, track down their operatives, and disrupt their plans. 
		We're determined to end the state sponsorship of terror -- and my nation 
		is grateful to all that participated in the liberation of Afghanistan. 
		We're determined to prevent proliferation, and to enforce the demands of 
		the world -- and my nation is grateful to the soldiers of many nations 
		who have helped to deliver the Iraqi people from an outlaw dictator.The dictator agreed in 1991, as a condition of a cease-fire, to fully 
		comply with all Security Council resolutions -- then ignored more than a 
		decade of those resolutions. Finally, the Security Council promised 
		serious consequences for his defiance. And the commitments we make must 
		have meaning. When we say ""serious consequences,"" for the sake of peace, 
		there must be serious consequences. And so a coalition of nations 
		enforced the just demands of the world.Defending our ideals is vital, but it is not enough. Our broader mission 
		as U.N. members is to apply these ideals to the great issues of our 
		time. Our wider goal is to promote hope and progress as the alternatives 
		to hatred and violence. Our great purpose is to build a better world 
		beyond the war on terror.Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have 
		established a global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. In 
		three years the contributing countries have funded projects in more than 
		90 countries, and pledged a total of $5.6 billion to these efforts. 
		America has undertaken a $15 billion effort to provide prevention and 
		treatment and humane care in nations afflicted by AIDS, placing a 
		special focus on 15 countries where the need is most urgent. AIDS is the 
		greatest health crisis of our time, and our unprecedented commitment 
		will bring new hope to those who have walked too long in the shadow of 
		death.Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have 
		joined together to confront the evil of trafficking in human beings. 
		We're supporting organizations that rescue the victims, passing stronger 
		anti-trafficking laws, and warning travelers that they will be held to 
		account for supporting this modern form of slavery. Women and children 
		should never be exploited for pleasure or greed, anywhere on Earth.Because we believe in human dignity, we should take seriously the 
		protection of life from exploitation under any pretext. In this session, 
		the U.N. will consider a resolution sponsored by Costa Rica calling for 
		a comprehensive ban on human cloning. I support that resolution and urge 
		all governments to affirm a basic ethical principle: No human life 
		should ever be produced or destroyed for the benefit of another.Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have 
		changed the way we fight poverty, curb corruption, and provide aid. In 
		2002 we created the Monterrey Consensus, a bold approach that links new 
		aid from developed nations to real reform in developing ones. And 
		through the Millennium Challenge Account, my nation is increasing our 
		aid to developing nations that expand economic freedom and invest in the 
		education and health of their own people.Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have acted 
		to lift the crushing burden of debt that limits the growth of developing 
		economies, and holds millions of people in poverty. Since these efforts 
		began in 1996, poor countries with the heaviest debt burdens have 
		received more than $30 billion of relief. And to prevent the build-up of 
		future debt, my country and other nations have agreed that international 
		financial institutions should increasingly provide new aid in the form 
		of grants, rather than loans.Because we believe in human dignity, the world must have more effective 
		means to stabilize regions in turmoil, and to halt religious violence 
		and ethnic cleansing. We must create permanent capabilities to respond 
		to future crises. The United States and Italy have proposed a Global 
		Peace Operations Initiative. G-8 countries will train 75,000 
		peacekeepers, initially from Africa, so they can conduct operations on 
		that continent and elsewhere. The countries of the G-8 will help this 
		peacekeeping force with deployment and logistical needs.At this hour, the world is witnessing terrible suffering and horrible 
		crimes in the Darfur region of Sudan, crimes my government has concluded 
		are genocide. The United States played a key role in efforts to broker a 
		cease-fire, and we're providing humanitarian assistance to the Sudanese 
		people. Rwanda and Nigeria have deployed forces in Sudan to help improve 
		security so aid can be delivered. The Security Council adopted a new 
		resolution that supports an expanded African Union force to help prevent 
		further bloodshed, and urges the government of Sudan to stop flights by 
		military aircraft in Darfur. We congratulate the members of the Council 
		on this timely and necessary action. I call on the government of Sudan 
		to honor the cease-fire it signed, and to stop the killing in Darfur.Because we believe in human dignity, peaceful nations must stand for the 
		advance of democracy. No other system of government has done more to 
		protect minorities, to secure the rights of labor, to raise the status 
		of women, or to channel human energy to the pursuits of peace. We've 
		witnessed the rise of democratic governments in predominantly Hindu and 
		Muslim, Buddhist, Jewish and Christian cultures. Democratic institutions 
		have taken root in modern societies, and in traditional societies. When 
		it comes to the desire for liberty and justice, there is no clash of 
		civilizations. People everywhere are capable of freedom, and worthy of 
		freedom.Finding the full promise of representative government takes time, as 
		America has found in two centuries of debate and struggle. Nor is there 
		any -- only one form of representative government -- because 
		democracies, by definition, take on the unique character of the peoples 
		that create them. Yet this much we know with certainty: The desire for 
		freedom resides in every human heart. And that desire cannot be 
		contained forever by prison walls, or martial laws, or secret police. 
		Over time, and across the Earth, freedom will find a way.Freedom is finding a way in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and we must continue 
		to show our commitment to democracies in those nations. The liberty that 
		many have won at a cost must be secured. As members of the United 
		Nations, we all have a stake in the success of the world's newest 
		democracies.Not long ago, outlaw regimes in Baghdad and Kabul threatened the peace 
		and sponsored terrorists. These regimes destabilized one of the world's 
		most vital -- and most volatile -- regions. They brutalized their 
		peoples, in defiance of all civilized norms. Today, the Iraqi and Afghan 
		people are on the path to democracy and freedom. The governments that 
		are rising will pose no threat to others. Instead of harboring 
		terrorists, they're fighting terrorist groups. And this progress is good 
		for the long-term security of us all.The Afghan people are showing extraordinary courage under difficult 
		conditions. They're fighting to defend their nation from Taliban 
		holdouts, and helping to strike against the terrorists killers. They're 
		reviving their economy. They've adopted a constitution that protects the 
		rights of all, while honoring their nation's most cherished traditions. 
		More than 10 million Afghan citizens -- over 4 million of them women -- 
		are now registered to vote in next month's presidential election. To any 
		who still would question whether Muslim societies can be democratic 
		societies, the Afghan people are giving their answer.Since the last meeting of this General Assembly, the people of Iraq have 
		regained sovereignty. Today, in this hall, the Prime Minister of Iraq 
		and his delegation represent a country that has rejoined the community 
		of nations. The government of Prime Minister Allawi has earned the 
		support of every nation that believes in self-determination and desires 
		peace. And under Security Council resolutions 1511 and 1546, the world 
		is providing that support. The U.N., and its member nations, must 
		respond to Prime Minister Allawi's request, and do more to help build an 
		Iraq that is secure, democratic, federal, and free.A democratic Iraq has ruthless enemies, because terrorists know the 
		stakes in that country. They know that a free Iraq in the heart of the 
		Middle East will be a decisive blow against their ambitions for that 
		region. So a terrorists group associated with al Qaeda is now one of the 
		main groups killing the innocent in Iraq today -- conducting a campaign 
		of bombings against civilians, and the beheadings of bound men. 
		Coalition forces now serving in Iraq are confronting the terrorists and 
		foreign fighters, so peaceful nations around the world will never have 
		to face them within our own borders.Our coalition is standing beside a growing Iraqi security force. The 
		NATO Alliance is providing vital training to that force. More than 35 
		nations have contributed money and expertise to help rebuild Iraq's 
		infrastructure. And as the Iraqi interim government moves toward 
		national elections, officials from the United Nations are helping Iraqis 
		build the infrastructure of democracy. These selfless people are doing 
		heroic work, and are carrying on the great legacy of Sergio de Mello.As we have seen in other countries, one of the main terrorist goals is 
		to undermine, disrupt, and influence election outcomes. We can expect 
		terrorist attacks to escalate as Afghanistan and Iraq approach national 
		elections. The work ahead is demanding. But these difficulties will not 
		shake our conviction that the future of Afghanistan and Iraq is a future 
		of liberty. The proper response to difficulty is not to retreat, it is 
		to prevail.The advance of freedom always carries a cost, paid by the bravest among 
		us. America mourns the losses to our nation, and to many others. And 
		today, I assure every friend of Afghanistan and Iraq, and every enemy of 
		liberty: We will stand with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq until 
		their hopes of freedom and security are fulfilled.These two nations will be a model for the broader Middle East, a region 
		where millions have been denied basic human rights and simple justice. 
		For too long, many nations, including my own, tolerated, even excused, 
		oppression in the Middle East in the name of stability. Oppression 
		became common, but stability never arrived. We must take a different 
		approach. We must help the reformers of the Middle East as they work for 
		freedom, and strive to build a community of peaceful, democratic 
		nations.This commitment to democratic reform is essential to resolving the 
		Arab-Israeli conflict. Peace will not be achieved by Palestinian rulers 
		who intimidate opposition, tolerate corruption, and maintain ties to 
		terrorist groups. The longsuffering Palestinian people deserve better. 
		They deserve true leaders capable of creating and governing a free and 
		peaceful Palestinian state.Even after the setbacks and frustrations of recent months, goodwill and 
		hard effort can achieve the promise of the road map to peace. Those who 
		would lead a new Palestinian state should adopt peaceful means to 
		achieve the rights of their people, and create the reformed institutions 
		of a stable democracy. Arab states should end incitement in their own 
		media, cut off public and private funding for terrorism, and establish 
		normal relations with Israel. Israel should impose a settlement freeze, 
		dismantle unauthorized outposts, end the daily humiliation of the 
		Palestinian people, and avoid any actions that prejudice final 
		negotiations. And world leaders should withdraw all favor and support 
		from any Palestinian ruler who fails his people and betrays their cause.The democratic hopes we see growing in the Middle East are growing 
		everywhere. In the words of the Burmese democracy advocate,Aung San Suu 
		Kyi:We do not accept the notion that democracy is a Western value. To 
		the contrary, democracy simply means good government rooted in 
		responsibility, transparency, and accountability.1Here at the United 
		Nations, you know this to be true. In recent years, this organization 
		has helped create a new democracy in East Timor, and the U.N. has aided 
		other nations in making the transition to self-rule.Because I believe the advance of liberty is the path to both a safer and 
		better world, today I propose establishing a Democracy Fund within the 
		United Nations. This is a great calling for this great organization. The 
		fund would help countries lay the foundations of democracy by 
		instituting the rule of law and independent courts, a free press, 
		political parties and trade unions. Money from the fund would also help 
		set up voter precincts and polling places, and support the work of 
		election monitors. To show our commitment to the new Democracy Fund, the 
		United States will make an initial contribution. I urge other nations to 
		contribute, as well.Today, I've outlined a broad agenda to advance human dignity, and 
		enhance the security of all of us. The defeat of terror, the protection 
		of human rights, the spread of prosperity, the advance of democracy -- 
		these causes, these ideals, call us to great work in the world. Each of 
		us alone can only do so much. Together, we can accomplish so much more.History will honor the high ideals of this organization. The charter 
		states them with clarity: ""to save succeeding generations from the 
		scourge of war,"" ""to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights,"" ""to 
		promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.""Let history also record that our generation of leaders followed through 
		on these ideals, even in adversity. Let history show that in a decisive 
		decade, members of the United Nations did not grow weary in our duties, 
		or waver in meeting them. I'm confident that this young century will be 
		liberty's century. I believe we will rise to this moment, because I know 
		the character of so many nations and leaders represented here today. And 
		I have faith in the transforming power of freedom.*May God bless you.*",general assembly nation general assembly addressdelivered september new york nyaudio require flash audioyour browser support

long night, and a great night.The voters turned out in record numbers and

comes first.Laura is the love of my life. I'm glad you love 
her, too.I want to thank our daughters, who joined their dad for his last

we will uphold our deepest values of family and faith.We'll help the emerging democracies of Iraq and

war on terror with every resource of our national power, so our children can live 
in freedom and in peace.Reaching these goals will require the broad 
support of Americans, so today I want to speak to every person who voted for my 
opponent. To make this nation stronger and better, I will 
need your support and I will work to earn it. I will do all I can do to deserve 
your trust.A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to 
the whole nation. We have one country, one constitution, and one future that 
binds us. And when we come together and work together, 
there is no limit to the greatness of America.Let me close with a word to the people of the 
state of Texas. We have known each other the longest, and you started me on this 
journey. On the open plains of Texas, I first learned the 
character of our country -- sturdy and honest, and as hopeful as the break of day. I will always be grateful to the good people of 
my State. And whatever the road that lies ahead, that road will take me home.A campaign has ended, and the United States of 
America goes forward with confidence and faith.I see a great day coming for our country, and I 
am eager for the work ahead.God bless you.

audio.]Please be seated. Thank you all 
very much. Thanks for the warm welcome. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you, and Mrs. 
Martin, for a fantastic dinner last night in Ottawa. We really loved it. My only 
regret today is that Laura is not with me. She is -- went home to thank those 
who have been decorating the White House for the great Christmas season that's 
coming up. I married well.I appreciate the Premiers who are here. Premier 
Hamm, thank you for your hospitality. Premier Lord, Premier Binns, and Premier 
Williams, I appreciate you all joining. I want to specifically mention the 
Premiers 'cause, as an ex-governor, I feel a special kinship to those who run 
the provinces here in Canada. But thank you for your service. Ambassador 
Cellucci, mayors, local officials, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I 
am honored to be with you today to reaffirm America's enduring ties to your 
country. I am really glad to be in Canada, and I'm really glad to be among 
friends. I appreciate the warm hospitality we've received.In the past year, I've come to know your new 
Prime Minister. We've met in Mexico, in the United States, in Chile, and now in 
Canada. Paul Martin is a leader who is asserting Canada's good influence in the 
world. And as I prepare for a second term in office, I look forward to a 
successful working partnership between our two countries.Paul and I share a great vision for the future, 
two prosperous, independent nations joined together by the return of NHL hockey.I told Paul that I really have only one regret 
about this visit to Canada. There's a prominent citizen who endorsed me in the 
2000 election, and I wanted a chance to finally thank him for that -- that 
endorsement. I was hoping to meetJean Poutine.I'm proud to stand in this historic place, 
which has welcomed home so many Canadians who defended liberty overseas, and 
where so many new Canadians began their North American dream. I'm grateful for 
the hospitality shown by the people of this fine city who have been so very kind 
to Americans before.Three years ago, Halifax and other towns and 
villages -- from Newfoundland to Manitoba to the Northwest Territories to 
British Columbia -- welcomed, as the Prime Minister mentioned, more than 33,000 
passengers on diverted flights. For days after September the 11th, Canadians 
came to the aid of men and women and children who were worried and confused and 
had nowhere to sleep. You opened your homes and your churches to strangers. You 
brought food; you set up clinics; you arranged for calls to their loved ones, 
and you asked for nothing in return.One 
American declared, ""My heart is overwhelmed at the outpouring of Canadian 
compassion. How does a person say 'thank you' to a nation?"" Well, that's 
something a President can do. And so let me say directly to the Canadian people, 
and to all of you here today who welcomed Americans, thank you for your kindness 
to America in an hour of need.That emergency revealed the good and generous 
heart of this country, and showed the true feelings of Canadians and Americans 
toward each other. The affection that appeared in an instant will always be 
there, and it runs deep. Beyond the words of politicians and the natural 
disagreements that nations will have, our two peoples are one family, and always 
will be.We're united in part by the daily contact of 
commerce, and both our nations are better off for it. In the 10 years since theNorth American Free Trade Agreementwas 
enacted, trade between the United States and Canada has nearly doubled. 
Twenty-three percent of America's exports go directly north; and more than 80 
percent of Canadians' exports go to my country. With so much trade, there are 
bound to be some disagreements. I proudly ate some Alberta beef last night and 
I'm still standing. With determined efforts, and relying on sound science and 
mutual goodwill, we can resolve issues. Take, for example, those PEI potatoes. 
Right, Mr. Premier?Canada represents America's most vital trade 
relationship in the whole world, and we will do all that is necessary to keep 
that relationship strong.Yet, our ties go deeper than trade. Our 
community of values reaches back centuries. Canada and the U.S. may have 
disagreed on the wisdom of separating from the Crown, but we've always agreed on 
the great principles of liberty derived from our common heritage. We believe in 
the dignity of every human life, and we believe in the right of every person to 
live in freedom. We believe in free markets, humanized by compassion and 
fairness. We believe a diverse society can also be united by principles of 
justice and equality. The values we hold have made us good neighbors for 
centuries, and they will keep us as strong allies and good friends for the 
centuries to come.These shared convictions have also led our 
great democracies to accept a mission in the wider world. We know it is not 
possible to live in quiet isolation of our peaceful continent, hoping the 
problems and challenges of other nations will pass us by. We know there can be 
no security, no lasting peace in a world where proliferation and terrorism, and 
genocide, and extreme poverty go unopposed.We know that our own interests are served by an 
international system that advances human rights, and open societies, and free 
trade, and the rule of law, and the hope that comes from self-government. Both 
Canada and the United States have accepted important global duties, and we will 
meet those responsibilities, for our own benefit and for the good of mankind.Canada's leadership is helping to build a 
better world. Over the past decade, Canadian troops have helped bring stability 
to Bosnia and Kosovo. Canada's willingness to send peacekeepers to Haiti saved 
thousands of lives and helped save Haiti's constitutional government. Canadian 
troops are serving bravely in Afghanistan at this hour. Other Canadians stand on 
guard for peace in the Middle East, in Cyprus, Sudan, and the Congo.Just two weeks ago, NATO countries showed their 
esteem for your military by electing General Ray Henault as Chairman of NATO's 
Military Committee. This admiration for your armed forces goes way back, and for 
good reason. It was said during World War I, the Canadians never budge. America 
respects the skill and honor and the sacrifice of Canadians' armed -- Canada's 
armed forces.Our nations play independent roles in the 
world, yet our purposes are complementary. We have important work ahead. A new 
term in office is an important opportunity to reach out to our friends. I hope 
to foster a wide international consensus among three great goals. The first 
great commitment is to defend our security and spread freedom by building 
effective multinational and multilateral institutions and supporting effective 
multilateral action.The tasks of the 21st century, from fighting 
proliferation to fighting the scourge of HIV/AIDS, to fighting poverty and 
hungry [sic] cannot be accomplished by a single nation alone. The United States 
and Canada participate together in more multilateral institutions than perhaps 
any two nations on Earth -- from NATO in Europe to the OAS in the Western 
Hemisphere to APEC in the Pacific. Canada and the United States are working with 
a coalition of nations through the Proliferation Security Initiative to stop and 
seize shipments of weapons of mass destruction, materials and delivery systems 
on land and at sea and in the air.America always prefers to act with allies at 
our side, and we're grateful to Canada for working closely with us to confront 
the challenges of Iran and North Korea. Multilateral organizations can do great 
good in the world.Yet, the success of multilateralism is measured 
not merely by following a process, but by achieving results. The objective of 
the U.N. and other institutions must be collective security, not endless debate. 
For the sake of peace, when those bodies promise serious consequences, serious 
consequences must follow. America and Canada helped create the United Nations, 
and because we remain committed to that institution, we want it to be more than 
a League of Nations.My country is determined to work as far as 
possible within the framework of international organizations, and we're hoping 
that other nations will work with us to make those institutions more relevant 
and more effective in meeting the unique threats of our time.Our second commitment is to fight global 
terrorism with every action and resource the task requires. Canada has taken a 
series of critical steps to guard against the danger of terrorism. You created 
the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. You've toughened 
your anti-terror laws. You're upgrading your intelligence. I want to thank the 
government for all those constructive and important decisions.Our two countries are working together every 
day -- every day -- to keep our people safe. That is the most solemn duty I 
have, and the most solemn duty the Prime Minister has. From thesmart border accordto thecontainer security initiativeto the joint 
command of NORAD, we are working together. I hope we'll also move forward on 
ballistic missile defense cooperation to protect the next generation of 
Canadians and Americans from the threats we know will arise.The energetic defense of our nations is an 
important duty. Yet, defense alone is not a sufficient strategy. On September 
the 11th, the people of North America learned that the two vast oceans and 
friendly neighbors cannot fully shield us from the dangers of the 21st century. 
There's only one way to deal with enemies who plot in secret and set out to 
murder the innocent and the unsuspecting: We must take the fight to them. We 
must be relentless and we must be steadfast in our duty to protect our people.Both of the countries have learned this lesson. 
In the early days of World War II, when the United States was still wrestling 
with isolationism, Canadian forces were already engaging the enemies of freedom 
from the Atlantic -- across the Atlantic. At the time, some Canadians argued 
that Canada had not been attacked and had no interest in fighting a distant war. 
Your Prime Minister, McKenzie King, gave this answer: ""We cannot defend our 
country and save our homes and families by waiting for the enemy to attack us. 
To remain on the defensive is the surest way to bring the war to Canada. Of 
course, we should protect our coasts and strengthen our ports and cities against 
attack,"" but the Prime Minister went on to say, ""we must also go out and meet 
the enemy before he reaches our shores. We must defeat him before he attacks us, 
before our cities are laid to waste."" McKenzie King was correct then, and we 
must always remember the wisdom of his words today.In the new era the threat is different, but our 
duties are the same. Our enemies have declared their intentions -- and so have 
we. Peaceful nations must keep the peace by going after the terrorists and 
disrupting their plans and cutting off their funding. We must hold the sponsors 
of terror equally responsible for terrorist acts. We must prevent outlaw regimes 
from gaining weapons of mass destruction and providing them to terrorists. We 
must stay at these efforts with patience and resolve, until we prevail.Our third great commitment is to enhance our 
own security by promoting freedom and hope and democracy in the broader Middle 
East. The United States and Canada and all free nations need to look ahead. If, 
20 years from now, the Middle East is dominated by dictators and mullahs who 
build weapons of mass destruction and harbor terrorists, our children and our 
grandchildren will live in a nightmare world of danger. That must not happen.By taking the side of reformers and democrats 
in the Middle East, we will gain allies in the war on terror, and isolate the 
ideology of murder and help to defeat the despair and hopelessness that feeds 
terror. The world will become a much safer place as democracy advances.For decades of tyranny and neglect in the 
broader Middle East, progress toward freedom will not come easily. I know that. 
Yet, it is cultural condescension to claim that some peoples or some cultures or 
some religions are destined to despotism and unsuited for self-government.Today in the Middle East, the doubters and 
pessimists are being proven wrong. We're seeing movement toward elections, and 
greater rights for women, and open discussion of peaceful reform. I believe that 
people across the Middle East are weary of poverty and oppression and plead in 
silence for their liberty. I believe this is an historic moment in the broader 
Middle East, and we must seize this moment by standing with everyone who stands 
for liberty.We're standing with the people of Afghanistan, 
a nation that has gone from a safe haven for terrorists to a steadfast ally in 
the war on terror in three-and-a-half short years. Canada deployed more than 
7,000 troops and much of your navy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. 
This year, your country has led the International Security Assistance Force in 
Kabul. The coalition we share is doing honorable work; yet democracy is taking 
hold in that country because the Afghan people, like people everywhere, want to 
live in freedom. They registered by the millions to vote in October. They stood 
in long lines on election day. An Afghan widow brought all four of her daughters 
to vote alongside her. She said, ""When you see women here lined up to vote, this 
is something profound. I never dreamed this day would come."" But that woman's 
dream finally arrived, as it will one day across the Middle East. These are 
unprecedented, historic events that many said would never come. And Canadians 
can be proud of the part you have played in the advance of human liberty.We must also stand with the brave people of 
Iraq who are preparing for elections on January the 30th. Sometimes, even the 
closest of friends disagree. And two years ago, we disagreed about the best 
course of action in Iraq. Yet, as your Prime Minister made clear in Washington 
earlier this year, there is no disagreement at all with what has to be done in 
going forward. We must help the Iraqi people secure their country and build a 
free and democratic society. The Canadian government has pledged more than 200 
million dollars in humanitarian aid and reconstruction assistance, and agreed to 
relieve more than 450 million dollars in Iraqi debt. That help is greatly 
appreciated.There's more work to be done together. Both 
Canada and the United States, and all free nations, have a vital interest in the 
success of a free Iraq. The terrorists have made Iraq the central front in the 
war on terror because they know what is at stake. When a free and democratic 
society is established in Iraq, in the heart of the Middle East, it will be a 
decisive blow to their aspirations to dominate the region and its people. A free 
Iraq will be a standing rebuke to radicalism, and a model to reformers from 
Damascus to Tehran.In 
Fallujah and elsewhere, our coalition and Iraqi forces are on the offensive and 
we are delivering a message: Freedom, not oppression, is the future of Iraq. 
Freedom is a precious right for every individual, regardless of the color of 
their skin or the religion they may hold. A long night of terror and tyranny in 
that region is ending, and a new day of freedom and hope and self-government is 
on the way.And we will stand with the Palestinian and 
Israeli peoples and help end the destructive conflict between them. Prime 
Minister Martin has expressed the desire of his government to take a broader 
role in the quest for peace and democracy, and America welcomes your 
involvement. It's a time of change and a time of hope in that region.We seek justice and dignity, and a viable 
independent and democratic state for the Palestinian people. We seek security 
and peace for the state of Israel, a state that Canada, like America, first 
recognized in 1948. These are worthy goals in themselves, and by reaching them, 
we will also remove an excuse for hatred and violence in the broader Middle 
East.Achieving peace in the Holy Land is not just a 
matter of pressuring one side or the other on the shape of a border or the site 
of a settlement. This approach has been tried before, without success. As we 
negotiate the details of peace, we must look to the heart of the matter, which 
is the need for a Palestinian democracy. The Palestinian people deserve a 
peaceful government that truly serves their interests, and the Israeli people 
need a true partner in peace.Our destination is clear: two states, Israel 
and Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and security. And that destination 
can be reached by only one path, the path of democracy and reform and the rule 
of law. If all parties will apply effort, if all nations who are concerned about 
this issue will apply goodwill, this conflict can end and peace can be achieved. 
And the time for that effort and the time for that goodwill is now.The United States and Canada face common 
threats in our world, and we share common goals that can transform our world. 
We're bound by history and geography and trade, and by our deepest convictions. 
With so much in common and so much at stake, we cannot be divided. I realize, 
and many Americans realize, that it's not always easy to sleep next to the 
elephant. Sometimes, our laws and our actions affect Canada every bit as much as 
they affect us, and we need to remember that. And when frustrations are vented, 
we must not take it personally. As a member of Canada's Parliament said in the 
1960s, ""The United States is our friend, whether we like it or not."" When all is 
said and done, we are friends -- and we like it.Three years ago, when the American planes were 
diverted away from home, passengers knew they were safe and welcome the moment 
they saw the Maple Leaf flag. One of them later said of the Canadians he met, 
""They taught me the meaning of the word, 'friend.'"" For generations, the nation 
of Canada has defined the word, ""friend,"" and my country is grateful.God has blessed America in many ways. God has 
blessed us 'cause we have neighbors like you. And today, I ask that God 
continues to bless the people of Canada.Thank you.",canada relation war canada relation war terrorismdelivered december halifax nova scotia canadaaudio addressyour browser support audio pdf

for pdfVice President Cheney, Mr. 
		Chief Justice, President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, 
		reverend clergy, distinguished guests, fellow citizens:On this day, prescribed by 
		law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom of our 
		Constitution, and recall the deep commitments that unite our country. I 
		am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential 
		times in which we live, and determined to fulfill the oath that I have 
		sworn and you have witnessed.At this second gathering, 
		our duties are defined not by the words I use, but by the history we 
		have seen together. For a half century, America defended our own freedom 
		by standing watch on distant borders. After the shipwreck of communism 
		came years of relative quiet, years of repose, years of sabbatical -- and 
		then there came a day of fire.We have seen our 
		vulnerability --- and we have seen its deepest source. For as long as 
		whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny --- prone to 
		ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder --- violence will gather, 
		and multiply in destructive power, and cross the most defended borders, 
		and raise a mortal threat. There is only one force of history that can 
		break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of 
		tyrants, and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is 
		the force of human freedom.We are led, by events and 
		common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land 
		increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best 
		hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the 
		world.America's vital interests 
		and our deepest beliefs are now one. From the day of our Founding, we 
		have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights, and 
		dignity, and matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker 
		of Heaven and earth. Across the generations we have proclaimed the 
		imperative of self-government, because no one is fit to be a master, and 
		no one deserves to be a slave. Advancing these ideals is the mission 
		that created our Nation. It is the honorable achievement of our fathers. 
		Now it is the urgent requirement of our nation's security, and the 
		calling of our time.So it is the policy of the 
		United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and 
		institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of 
		ending tyranny in our world.This is not primarily the 
		task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force 
		of arms when necessary. Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen, and 
		defended by citizens, and sustained by the rule of law and the 
		protection of minorities. And when the soul of a nation finally speaks, 
		the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very 
		different from our own. America will not impose our own style of 
		government on the unwilling. Our goal instead is to help others find 
		their own voice, attain their own freedom, and make their own way.The great objective of 
		ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations. The difficulty 
		of the task is no excuse for avoiding it. America's influence is not 
		unlimited, but fortunately for the oppressed, America's influence is 
		considerable, and we will use it confidently in freedom's cause.My most solemn duty is to 
		protect this nation and its people against further attacks and emerging 
		threats. Some have unwisely chosen to test America's resolve, and have 
		found it firm.We will persistently clarify 
		the choice before every ruler and every nation: The moral choice between 
		oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally 
		right. America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their 
		chains, or that women welcome humiliation and servitude, or that any 
		human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies.We will encourage reform in 
		other governments by making clear that success in our relations will 
		require the decent treatment of their own people. America's belief in 
		human dignity will guide our policies, yet rights must be more than the 
		grudging concessions of dictators; they are secured by free dissent and 
		the participation of the governed. In the long run, there is no justice 
		without freedom, and there can be no human rights without human liberty.Some, I know, have 
		questioned the global appeal of liberty --- though this time in history, 
		four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an 
		odd time for doubt. Americans, of all people, should never be surprised 
		by the power of our ideals. Eventually, the call of freedom comes to 
		every mind and every soul. We do not accept the existence of permanent 
		tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery. 
		Liberty will come to those who love it.Today, America speaks anew 
		to the peoples of the world:All who live in tyranny and 
		hopelessness can know: the United States will not ignore your 
		oppression, or excuse your oppressors. When you stand for your liberty, 
		we will stand with you.Democratic reformers facing 
		repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for who you are: 
		the future leaders of your free country.The rulers of outlaw regimes 
		can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did: ""Those who deny 
		freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of 
		a just God, cannot long retain it.""The leaders of governments 
		with long habits of control need to know: To serve your people you must 
		learn to trust them. Start on this journey of progress and justice, and 
		America will walk at your side.And all the allies of the 
		United States can know: we honor your friendship, we rely on your 
		counsel, and we depend on your help. Division among free nations is a 
		primary goal of freedom's enemies. The concerted effort of free nations 
		to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies' defeat.Today, I also speak anew to 
		my fellow citizens:From all of you, I have 
		asked patience in the hard task of securing America, which you have 
		granted in good measure. Our country has accepted obligations that are 
		difficult to fulfill, and would be dishonorable to abandon. Yet because 
		we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation, tens of 
		millions have achieved their freedom. And as hope kindles hope, millions 
		more will find it. By our efforts, we have lit a fire as well --- a fire 
		in the minds of men. It warms those who feel its power, it burns those 
		who fight its progress, and one day this untamed fire of freedom will 
		reach the darkest corners of our world.A few Americans have 
		accepted the hardest duties in this cause --- in the quiet work of 
		intelligence and diplomacy, the idealistic work of helping raise up 
		free governments, the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our 
		enemies. Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that 
		honored their whole lives --- and we will always honor their names and 
		their sacrifice.All Americans have witnessed 
		this idealism, and some for the first time. I ask our youngest citizens 
		to believe the evidence of your eyes. You have seen duty and allegiance 
		in the determined faces of our soldiers. You have seen that life is 
		fragile, and evil is real, and courage triumphs. Make the choice to 
		serve in a cause larger than your wants, larger than yourself --- and in 
		your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country, but to its 
		character.America has need of idealism 
		and courage, because we have essential work at home --- the unfinished 
		work of American freedom. In a world moving toward liberty, we are 
		determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty.In America's ideal of 
		freedom, citizens find the dignity and security of economic 
		independence, instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence. This is 
		the broader definition of liberty that motivated the Homestead Act, the 
		Social Security Act, and the G.I. Bill of Rights. And now we will extend 
		this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our 
		time. To give every American a stake in the promise and future of our 
		country, we will bring the highest standards to our schools, and build 
		an ownership society. We will widen the ownership of homes and 
		businesses, retirement savings and health insurance --- preparing our 
		people for the challenges of life in a free society. By making every 
		citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow 
		Americans greater freedom from want and fear, and make our society more 
		prosperous and just and equal.In America's ideal of 
		freedom, the public interest depends on private character --- on 
		integrity, and tolerance toward others, and the rule of conscience in 
		our own lives. Self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of 
		the self. That edifice of character is built in families, supported by 
		communities with standards, and sustained in our national life by the 
		truths of Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the Koran, and 
		the varied faiths of our people. Americans move forward in every 
		generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before --- 
		ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, today, and 
		forever.In America's ideal of 
		freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service, and mercy, and a 
		heart for the weak. Liberty for all does not mean independence from one 
		another. Our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor 
		and surround the lost with love. Americans, at our best, value the life 
		we see in one another, and must always remember that even the unwanted 
		have worth. And our country must abandon all the habits of racism, 
		because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of 
		bigotry at the same time.From the perspective of a 
		single day, including this day of dedication, the issues and questions 
		before our country are many. From the viewpoint of centuries, the 
		questions that come to us are narrowed and few. Did our generation 
		advance the cause of freedom? And did our character bring credit to that 
		cause?These questions that judge 
		us also unite us, because Americans of every party and background, 
		Americans by choice and by birth, are bound to one another in the cause 
		of freedom. We have known divisions, which must be healed to move 
		forward in great purposes --- and I will strive in good faith to heal 
		them. Yet those divisions do not define America. We felt the unity and 
		fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack, and our 
		response came like a single hand over a single heart. And we can feel 
		that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good, and the 
		victims of disaster are given hope, and the unjust encounter justice, 
		and the captives are set free.We go forward with complete 
		confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom. Not because history runs 
		on the wheels of inevitability; it is human choices that move events. 
		Not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation; God moves and chooses 
		as He wills. We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of 
		mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul. When our 
		Founders declared a new order of the ages; when soldiers died in wave 
		upon wave for a union based on liberty; when citizens marched in 
		peaceful outrage under the banner ""Freedom Now"" -- they were acting on an 
		ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled. History has an ebb and flow 
		of justice, but history also has a visible direction, set by liberty and 
		the Author of Liberty.When the Declaration of 
		Independence was first read in public and the Liberty Bell was sounded 
		in celebration, a witness said, ""It rang as if it meant something."" In 
		our time it means something still. America, in this young century, 
		proclaims liberty throughout all the world, and to all the inhabitants 
		thereof. Renewed in our strength -- tested, but not weary -- we are ready 
		for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom.May God bless you, and may

Washington, D.C.Your  browser does not support the video tag.Audio mp3 of AddressPlug-in required for flash audioYour browser does not support the audio element.Today the people of Iraq have spoken to the 
world, and the world is hearing the voice of freedom from the center of the 
Middle East.In great numbers, and under great risk, Iraqis have 
shown their commitment to democracy. Byparticipating in free elections, the 
Iraqi people have firmly rejected the anti-democratic ideology of the 
terrorists. They have refused to be intimidated by thugs and assassins. And they 
have demonstrated the kind of courage that is always the foundation of 
self-government.Some Iraqis were killed while exercising their rights as citizens. We also mourn 
the American and British military personnel who lost their lives today. Their 
sacrifices were made in a vital cause of freedom, peace in a troubled region, 
and a more secure future for us all.The Iraqi people, themselves, made this election a resounding success. Brave 
patriots stepped forward as candidates. Many citizens volunteered as poll 
workers. More than 100,000 Iraqi security force personnel guarded polling places 
and conducted operations against terrorist groups. One news account told of a 
voter who had lost a leg in a terror attack last year, and went to the polls 
today, despite threats of violence. He said, ""I would have crawled here if I had 
to. I don't want terrorists to kill other Iraqis like they tried to kill me. 
Today I am voting for peace.""Across Iraq today, men and women have taken 
rightful control of their country's destiny, and they have chosen a future of 
freedom and peace. In this process, Iraqis have had many friends at their side. 
The European Union and the United Nations gave important assistance in the 
election process. The American military and our diplomats, working with our 
coalition partners, have been skilled and relentless, and their sacrifices have 
helped to bring Iraqis to this day. The people of the United States have been 
patient and resolute, even in difficult days.The commitment to a free Iraq now goes forward. 
This historic election begins the process of drafting and ratifying a new 
constitution, which will be the basis of a fully democratic Iraqi government. 
Terrorists and insurgents will continue to wage their war against democracy, and 
we will support the Iraqi people in their fight against them. We will continue 
training Iraqi security forces so this rising democracy can eventually take 
responsibility for its own security.There's more distance to travel on the road to 
democracy. Yet Iraqis are proving they're equal to the challenge. On behalf of 
the American people, I congratulate the people of Iraq on this great and 
historic achievement.Thank you very much.",eorge bush democratic election iraq democratic election iraqdelivered january washington browser support video require flash audioyour browser support audio people iraq speak world world hear voice freedom center middle great number great risk iraqi show commitment democracy byparticipating free election iraqi people firmly reject ideology terrorist refuse intimidate thug assassin demonstrate kind courage always foundation iraqi kill exercise right citizen also mourn american british military personnel lose live today sacrifice make vital cause freedom peace trouble region secure future u iraqi people make election resound success brave patriot step forward candidate many citizen volunteer poll worker iraqi security force personnel guard poll place conduct operation terrorist group one news account tell voter lose leg terror attack last year go poll today despite threat violence say would crawl want terrorist kill iraqi like try kill today vote peace across iraq today men woman take rightful control country destiny choose future freedom peace process iraqi many friend side european union unite nation give important assistance election process american military diplomat work coalition partner skilled relentless sacrifice help bring iraqi day people unite state patient resolute even difficult commitment free iraq go forward historic election begin process draft ratify new constitution basis fully democratic iraqi government terrorist insurgent continue wage war democracy support iraqi people fight continue train iraqi security force rise democracy eventually take responsibility distance travel road democracy yet iraqi prove equal challenge behalf american people congratulate people iraq great historic much,eorge election iraq election washington browser support video audioyour support audio people world world voice freedom center number risk iraqi democracy election iraqi people refuse intimidate thug assassin demonstrate kind courage foundation iraqi kill exercise right citizen personnel today sacrifice cause freedom peace trouble region secure future people election resound success step citizen poll worker security force personnel poll place conduct operation terrorist group news account leg terror attack year poll today threat violence terrorist iraqi try kill today peace iraq today men woman control country future freedom peace process union nation assistance election process diplomat work coalition partner relentless sacrifice help day people state patient resolute iraq election begin process draft constitution basis government insurgent continue wage war democracy support iraqi people security force rise democracy responsibility distance travel road democracy challenge behalf people people

for pdf[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from

audio.]Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, 

		fellow citizens:As a new Congress gathers, all of us in 

		the elected branches of government share a great privilege: We've been 

		placed in office by the votes of the people we serve. And tonight that is a privilege we share 

		with newly elected leaders of Afghanistan, the Palestinian territories, 

		Ukraine, and a free and sovereign Iraq.Two weeks ago, I stood on the steps of 

		this Capitol and renewed the commitment of our nation to the guiding 

		ideal of liberty for all. This evening I will set forth policies to 

		advance that ideal at home and around the world.Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, 

		with more Americans going back to work, with our nation an active force 

		for good in the world, the state of our union is confident and strong.

		Our generation has been blessed by the 

		expansion of opportunity, by advances in medicine, by the security 

		purchased by our parents' sacrifice. Now, as we see a little gray in the 

		mirror -- or a lot of gray -- and we watch our children moving into 

		adulthood, we ask the question: What will be the state of their union?Members of Congress, the choices we make 

		together will answer that question. Over the next several months, on 

		issue after issue, let us do what Americans have always done and build a 

		better world for our children and our grandchildren.First, we must be good stewards of this 

		economy and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow 

		citizens rely. America's economy is the fastest growing 

		of any major industrialized nation. In the past four years, we've provided 

		tax relief to every person who pays income taxes, overcome a recession, 

		opened up new markets abroad, prosecuted corporate criminals, raised 

		homeownership to its highest level in history. And in the last year 

		alone, the United States has added 2.3 million new jobs.When action was needed, the Congress 

		delivered, and the nation is grateful. Now we must add to these achievements. By 

		making our economy more flexible, more innovative and more competitive, 

		we will keep America the economic leader of the world.America's prosperity requires restraining 

		the spending appetite of the federal government. I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for 

		spending discipline. I will send you a budget that holds the 

		growth of discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief 

		permanent, and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. My budget substantially reduces or 

		eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting 

		results, or duplicate current efforts, or do not fulfill essential 

		priorities. The principle here is clear: Taxpayer 

		dollars must be spent wisely or not at all.To make our economy stronger and more 

		dynamic, we must prepare a rising generation to fill the jobs of the 

		21st century. Under theNo Child Left Behind Act, 

		standards are higher, test scores are on the rise, and we're closing the 

		achievement gap for minority students. Now we must demand better results from 

		our high schools so every high school diploma is a ticket to success.

		We will help additional -- an additional 200,000 

		workers to get training for a better career by reforming our 

		job-training system and strengthening America's community colleges. And we will make it easier for Americans 

		to afford a college education by increasing the size of Pell Grants.To make our economy stronger and more 

		competitive, America must reward, not punish, the efforts and dreams of 

		entrepreneurs. Small business is the path of 

		advancement, especially for women and minorities. So we must free small businesses from 

		needless regulation and protect honest job creators from junk lawsuits.Justice is distorted and our economy is 

		held back by irresponsible class actions and frivolous asbestos claims.

		And I urge Congress to pass legal reforms 

		this year.To make our economy stronger and more 

		productive, we must make health care more affordable and give families 

		greater access to good coverage and more control over their health 

		decisions.I -- I ask Congress to move forward on a 

		comprehensive health-care agenda with tax credits to help low-income 

		workers buy insurance; a community health center in every poor county; 

		improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless 

		costs; association health plans for small businesses and their 

		employees,  expanded health savings accounts, and medical liability reform that 

		will reduce health-care costs and make sure patients have the doctors 

		and care they need.To keep our economy growing, we also need 

		reliable supplies of affordable, environmentally responsible energy. Nearly four years ago, I submitted a 

		comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, alternative 

		sources, a modernized electricity grid and more production here at home, 

		including safe, clean nuclear energy.MyClear Skieslegislation will cut 

		power-plant pollution and improve the health of our citizens. And my budget provides strong funding for 

		leading-edge technology, from hydrogen-fueled cars to clean coal to 

		renewable sources such as ethanol. Four years of debate is enough. I urge 

		Congress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less 

		dependent on foreign energy.All these proposals are essential to 

		expand this economy and add new jobs, but they are just the beginning of 

		our duty. To build the prosperity of future 

		generations, we must update institutions that were created to meet the 

		needs of an earlier time. Year after year, Americans are burdened 

		by an archaic, incoherent federal tax code. I've appointed a bipartisan 

		panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom. And when their 

		recommendations are delivered, you and I will work together to give this 

		nation a tax code that is pro-growth, easy to understand, and fair to 

		all.America's immigration system is also 

		outdated -- unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of 

		our country. We should not be content with laws that punish hardworking 

		people who want only to provide for their families, and deny businesses willing workers, 

		and invite chaos at our border. It is time for an immigration policy that 

		permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs Americans will not take, 

		that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering and leaving our 

		country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists.One of America's most important 

		institutions -- a symbol of the trust between generations -- is also in 

		need of wise and effective reform. Social Security was a great moral success 

		of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new 

		century. The system, however, on its current path, 

		is headed toward bankruptcy. And so we must join together to strengthen 

		and save Social Security. Today, more than 45 million Americans 

		receive Social Security benefits, and millions more are nearing 

		retirement. And for them, the system is sound and fiscally strong.I have a message for every American who 

		is 55 or older: Do not let anyone mislead you. For you, the Social 

		Security system will not change in any way.For younger workers, the Social Security 

		system has serious problems that will grow worse with time. Social Security was created decades ago, 

		for a very different era. In those days, people did not live as long, 

		benefits were much lower than they are today, and a half century ago, 

		about 16 workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits.Our society has changed in ways the 

		founders of Social Security could not have foreseen. In today's world, 

		people are living longer and therefore drawing benefits longer. And 

		those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few 

		decades. And instead of 16 workers paying in for 

		every beneficiary, right now it's only about three workers. And over the 

		next few decades, that number will fall to just two workers per 

		beneficiary. With each passing year, fewer workers are 

		paying ever- higher benefits to an ever-larger number of retirees.So here is the result: Thirteen years 

		from now, in 2018, Social Security will be paying out more than it takes 

		in. And every year afterward will bring a new shortfall, bigger than the 

		year before. For example, in the year 2027, the 

		government will somehow have to come up with an extra 200 billion 

dollars to 

		keep the system afloat. And by 2033, the annual shortfall would be more 

		than 300 billion dollars. By the year 2042, the entire system would be 

		exhausted and bankrupt. If steps are not taken to avert that 

		outcome, the only solutions would be dramatically higher taxes, massive 

		new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts in Social Security benefits or 

		other government programs.I recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a 

		long way off. But those dates aren't so distant, as any parent will tell 

		you. If you have a 5-year-old, you're already concerned about how you'll 

		pay for college tuition 13 years down the road. If you've got children in their 20s, as 

		some of us do, the idea of Social Security collapsing before they retire 

		does not seem like a small matter. And it should not be a small matter 

		to the United States Congress.You and I share a responsibility. We must 

		pass reforms that solve the financial problems of Social Security once 

		and for all. Fixing Social Security permanently will 

		require an open, candid review of the options. Some have suggested limiting benefits for 

		wealthy retirees. Former Congressman Tim Penny has raised 

		the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages. During the 1990s, my predecessor, 

		President Clinton, spoke of increasing the retirement age. Former Senator John Breaux suggested 

		discouraging early collection of Social Security benefits. The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan 

		recommended changing the way benefits are calculated.All these ideas are on the table.I know that none of these reforms would 

		be easy. But we have to move ahead with courage and honesty, because our 

		children's retirement security is more important than partisan politics.I will work with members of Congress to 

		find the most effective combination of reforms. I will listen to anyone 

		who has a good idea to offer.We must, however, be guided by some basic 

		principles:- We must make Social Security permanently 

		sound, not leave that task for another day.- We must not jeopardize our economic 

		strength by increasing payroll taxes.- We must ensure that lower-income 

		Americans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in 

		their retirement.- We must guarantee that there is no change 

		for those now retired or nearing retirement.- And we must take care that any changes in 

		the system are gradual, so younger workers have years to prepare and 

		plan for their future.As we fix Social Security, we also have 

		the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers. 

		And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal 

		retirement accounts.Here is how the idea works: Right now, a set portion of the money you 

		earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the Social Security 

		benefits of today's retirees. If you're a younger worker, I believe you 

		should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement 

		account, so you can build a nest egg for your own future.Here is why the personal accounts are a 

		better deal: Your money will grow, over time, at a 

		greater rate than anything the current system can deliver. And your account will provide money for 

		retirement over and above the check you will receive from Social 

		Security. In addition, you'll be able to pass along 

		the money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to 

		your children and -- or grandchildren. And best of all, the money in the account 

		is yours, and the government can never take it away.The goal here is greater security in 

		retirement, so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts:

		We'll make sure the money can only go 

		into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds. We'll make sure that your earnings are 

		not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees. We'll make sure there are good options to 

		protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of your 

		retirement.We'll make sure a personal account cannot 

		be emptied out all at once, but rather paid out over time, as an 

		addition to traditional Social Security benefits. And we'll make sure this plan is fiscally 

		responsible by starting personal retirement accounts gradually and 

		raising the yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually 

		permitting all workers to set aside 4 percentage points of their payroll 

		taxes in their accounts. Personal retirement accounts should be 

		familiar to federal employees, because you already have something 

		similar, called the Thrift Savings Plan, which lets workers deposit a 

		portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly based 

		investment funds.It's time to extend the same security and 

		choice and ownership to young Americans.Our second great responsibility to our 

		children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass along the values that 

		sustain a free society. So many of my generation, after a long 

		journey, have come home to family and faith, and are determined to bring 

		up responsible, moral children. Government is not the source of these 

		values, but government should never undermine them.Because marriage is a sacred institution 

		and the foundation of society, it should not be redefined by activist 

		judges. For the good of families, children and society, I support a 

		constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage.Because a society is measured by how it 

		treats the weak and vulnerable, we must strive to build a culture of 

		life. Medical research can help us reach that 

		goal, by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people 

		overcome disabilities. And I thank the Congress for doubling the 

		funding of the National Institutes of Health. To build a culture of life, we must also 

		ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity, not take 

		advantage of some lives for the benefit of others.We should all be able to agree -- We should all be able to agree on some 

		clear standards. I will work with Congress to ensure that human embryos 

		are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts and that 

		human life is never bought or sold as a commodity. America will continue to lead the world 

		in medical research that is ambitious, aggressive, and always ethical.Because courts must always deliver 

		impartial justice, judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law, 

		not legislate from the bench. As President, I have a constitutional 

		responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of 

		courts in our democracy and are well-qualified to serve on the bench, 

		and I have done so.The Constitution also gives the Senate a 

		responsibility: Every judicial nominee deserves an up-or-down vote.Because one of the deepest values of our 

		country is compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen who 

		feels isolated from the opportunities of America. Our government will continue to support 

		faith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places. Now we need to focus on giving young 

		people, especially young men in our cities, better options than apathy 

		or gangs or jail.Tonight I propose a three-year initiative 

		to help organizations keep young people out of gangs and show young men 

		an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence. Taking on gang life will be one part of a 

		broader outreach to at-risk youth, which involves parents and pastors, 

		coaches and community leaders, in programs ranging from literacy to 

		sports. And I am proud that the leader of this 

		nationwide effort will be our First Lady, Laura Bush.Because HIV/AIDS brings suffering and 

		fear into so many lives, I ask you to reauthorize theRyan White Actto 

		encourage prevention and provide care and treatment to the victims of 

		that disease. And as we update this important law, we 

		must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new 

		cases: African-American men and women.Because one of the main sources of our 

		national unity is our belief in equal justice, we need to make sure 

		Americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system 

		that provides justice. In America we must make doubly sure no 

		person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit. So we 

		are dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful 

		conviction. Soon I will send to Congress a proposal 

		to fund special training for defense counsel in capital cases, because 

		people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their 

		side.Our third responsibility to future 

		generations is to leave them an America that is safe from danger and 

		protected by peace. We will pass along to our children all 

		the freedoms we enjoy. And chief among them is freedom from fear. In the three and a half years since 

		September the 11th, 2001, we've taken unprecedented actions to protect 

		Americans. We've created a new department of 

		government to defend our homeland, focused the FBI on preventing 

		terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken up terror 

		cells across the country, expanded research on defenses against 

		biological and chemical attack, improved border security, and trained 

		more than a half million first responders. Police and firefighters, air marshals, 

		researchers and so many others are working every day to make our 

		homeland safer, and we thank them all.Our nation, working with allies and 

		friends, has also confronted the enemy abroad with measures that are 

		determined, successful, and continuing. The Al Qaida terror network that attacked 

		our country still has leaders, but many of its top commanders have been 

		removed. There are still governments that sponsor 

		and harbor terrorists, but their number has declined. There are still regimes seeking weapons 

		of mass destruction, but no longer without attention and without 

		consequence. Our country is still the target of 

		terrorists who want to kill many and intimidate us all. And we will stay 

		on the offensive against them until the fight is won.Pursuing our enemies is a vital 

		commitment of the war on terror. And I thank the Congress for providing 

		our service men and women with the resources they have needed. During 

		this time of war, we must continue to support our military and give them 

		the tools for victory.Other nations around the globe have stood 

		with us. In Afghanistan, an international force is helping provide 

		security. In Iraq, 28 countries have troops on the ground. The United 

		Nations and the European Union provided technical assistance for the 

		elections. And NATO is leading a mission to help train Iraqi officers.We're cooperating with 60 governments in 

		the Proliferation Security Initiative to detect and stop the transit of 

		dangerous materials. We're working closely with the 

		governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear 

		ambitions. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and nine other 

		countries have captured or detained Al Qaida terrorists.In the next four years, my Administration 

		will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of 

		our time. In the long term, the peace we seek will 

		only be achieved by eliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and 

		ideologies of murder. If whole regions of the world remain in 

		despair and grow in hatred, they will be the recruiting grounds for 

		terror, and that terror will stalk America and other free nations for 

		decades. The only force powerful enough to stop 

		the rise of tyranny and terror and replace hatred with hope is the force 

		of human freedom.Our enemies know this, and that is why 

		the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the ""evil 

		principle"" of democracy. And we've declared our own intention: 

		America will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic 

		movements in the Middle East and beyond, with the ultimate goal of 

		ending tyranny in our world.The United States has no right, no desire, 

		and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else.That 

		is one -- That is one of the main differences 

		between us and our enemies. They seek to impose and expand an empire of 

		oppression, in which a tiny group of brutal, self-appointed rulers 

		control every aspect of every life. Our aim is to build and preserve a 

		community of free and independent nations, with governments that answer 

		to their citizens and reflect their own cultures.And because democracies respect their own 

		people and their neighbors, the advance of freedom will lead to peace.

		That advance has great momentum in our 

		time, shown by women voting in Afghanistan, and Palestinians choosing a 

		new direction, and the people of Ukraine asserting their democratic 

		rights and electing a president. We are witnessing landmark events in the 

		history of liberty. And in the coming years, we will add to that story.

		The beginnings of reform and democracy in 

		the Palestinian territories are now showing the power of freedom to 

		break old patterns of violence and failure.Tomorrow morning, Secretary of State Rice 

		departs on a trip that will take her to Israel and the West Bank for 

		meetings with Prime Minister Sharon and President Abbas. She will 

		discuss with them how we and our friends can help the Palestinian people 

		end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful, independent, 

		democratic state. To promote this democracy, I will ask 

		Congress for 350 million dollars to support Palestinian political, economic and 

		security reforms. The goal of two democratic states, Israel 

		and Palestine, living side by side in peace is within reach, and America 

		will help them achieve that goal.To promote peace and stability in the 

		broader Middle East, the United States will work with our friends in the 

		region to fight the common threat of terror, while we encourage a higher 

		standard of freedom. Hopeful reform is already taking hold in 

		an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain. The government of Saudi Arabia 

		can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of 

		its people in determining their future. And the great and proud nation 

		of Egypt, which showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now 

		show the way toward democracy in the Middle East.To promote peace in the broader Middle 

		East, we must confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and 

		pursue weapons of mass murder. Syria still allows its territory and 

		parts of Lebanon to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every 

		chance of peace in the region.You have passed, and we are applying, theSyrian Accountability Act. And we expect the Syrian government to end 

		all support for terror and open the door to freedom.Today, Iran remains the world's primary 

		state sponsor of terror -- pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its 

		people of the freedom they seek and deserve. We are working with European allies to 

		make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uranium 

		enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing and end its support 

		for terror. And to the Iranian people, I say tonight: 

		As you stand for your own liberty, America stands with you.Our generational commitment to the 

		advance of freedom, especially in the Middle East, is now being tested 

		and honored in Iraq. That country is a vital front in the war on terror, 

		which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there. Our men and women in uniform are fighting 

		terrorists in Iraq so we do not have to face them here at home.The victory of freedom in Iraq will 

		strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers 

		from Damascus to Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled 

		region, and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our 

		children and grandchildren. We will succeed because the Iraqi people 

		value their own liberty, as they showed the world last Sunday. Across Iraq, often at great risk, 

		millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to 

		represent them in a new transitional national assembly. A young woman in Baghdad told of waking 

		to the sound of mortar fire on election day and wondering if it might be 

		too dangerous to vote. She said, ""Hearing those explosions, it occurred 

		to me, the insurgents are weak; they are afraid of democracy; they are 

losing. So I got my husband, and I got my parents, and we all came out and voted 

together.""Americans recognize that spirit of 

		liberty, because we share it. In any nation, casting your vote is an act 

		of civic responsibility. For millions of Iraqis, it was also an act of 

		personal courage, and they have earned the respect of us all.One of Iraq's leading democracy and human 

		rights advocates is Safia Taleb al-Suhail. She says of her country, ""We 

		were occupied for 35 years by Saddam Hussein. That was the real 

		occupation. Thank you to the American people who paid the cost, but most 

		of all to the soldiers."" Eleven years ago, Safia's father was 

		assassinated by Saddam's intelligence service. Three days ago in 

		Baghdad, Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country. 

		And we are honored that she is with us tonight.The terrorists and insurgents are 

		violently opposed to democracy and will continue to attack it. Yet the 

		terrorists' most powerful myth is being destroyed. The whole world is seeing that the car 

		bombers and assassins are not only fighting coalition forces, they are 

		trying to destroy the hopes of Iraqis, expressed in free elections.

		And the whole world now knows that a 

		small group of extremists will not overturn the will of the Iraqi 

		people.We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis 

		are determined to fight for their own freedom and to write their own 

		history. As Prime Minister Allawi said in his speech to Congress last 

		September, ""Ordinary Iraqis are anxious to shoulder all the security 

burdens of our country as quickly as possible."" That is the natural desire of an 

		independent nation, and it also is the stated mission of our coalition 

		in Iraq.The new political situation in Iraq opens 

		a new phase of our work in that country. At the recommendation of our 

		commanders on the ground and in consultation with the Iraqi government, 

		we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable 

		Iraqi security forces -- forces with skilled officers and an effective 

		command structure.As those forces become more self-reliant 

		and take on greater security responsibilities, America and its coalition 

		partners will increasingly be in a supporting role. In the end, Iraqis 

		must be able to defend their own country, and we will help that proud, 

		new nation secure its liberty. Recently an Iraqi interpreter said to a 

		reporter, ""Tell America not to abandon us."" He and all Iraqis can be certain: While 

		our military strategy is adapting to circumstances, our commitment 

		remains firm and unchanging. We are standing for the freedom of our 

		Iraqi friends, and freedom in Iraq will make America safer for 

		generations to come.We will not set an artificial timetable 

		for leaving Iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and make 

		them believe they can wait us out. We are in Iraq to achieve a result: a 

		country that is democratic, representative of all its people, at peace 

		with its neighbors and able to defend itself. And when that result is achieved, our men 

		and women serving in Iraq will return home with the honor they have 

		earned.Right now, Americans in uniform are 

		serving at posts across the world, often taking great risks on my 

		orders. We have given them training and equipment. And they have given 

		us an example of idealism and character that makes every American proud.The volunteers of our military are 

		unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in honor and 

		decency, and every day they are making our nation more secure.Some of our service men and women have 

		survived terrible injuries, and this grateful nation will do everything 

		we can to help them recover.And we have said farewell to some very 

		good men and women who died for our freedom and whose memory this nation 

		will honor forever.One name we honor is Marine Corps 

		Sergeant Byron Norwood of Pflugerville, Texas, who was killed during the 

		assault on Fallujah. His mom, Janet, sent me a letter and told me how 

		much Byron loved being a Marine and how proud he was to be on the front 

		line against terror. She wrote, ""When Byron was home the last 

		time, I said that I wanted to protect him like I had since he was born. 

		He just hugged me and said, 'You've done your job, Mom. Now it is my 

		turn to protect you.'"" Ladies and gentlemen, with grateful 

		hearts, we honor freedom's defenders and our military families, 

		represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood's mom and dad, Janet 

		and Bill Norwood.In these four years, Americans have seen 

		the unfolding of large events. We have known times of sorrow and hours 

		of uncertainty and days of victory. In all this history, even when we 

		have disagreed, we have seen threads of purpose that unite us.The attack on freedom in our world has 

		reaffirmed our confidence in freedom's power to change the world. We're 

		all part of a great venture: to extend the promise of freedom in our 

		country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty and to spread the 

		peace that freedom brings.As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded 

		Americans, ""Each age is a dream that is dying or one that is coming to 

		birth.""And we live in the country where the 

		biggest dreams are born.The abolition of slavery was only a dream 

		-- until it was fulfilled.The liberation of Europe from fascism was 

		only a dream -- until it was achieved.The fall of imperial communism 

		was only a dream -- until, one day, it was accomplished.Our generation has dreams of its own, and 

		we also go forward with confidence. The road of providence is uneven and 

		unpredictable, yet we know where it leads: It leads to freedom.Thank you. And may God bless America.Also in this database:2001,2002,2003,2004,2006,2007,20082009,20102011201220132014201520162017State of the Union AddressesAudio and Images Source:

57,23 January 2006,">American Rhetoric: George W. Bush - Address at the National Defense 
University on the War on Terr","Thank you, all. Please be seated. It 
is great to be back to this fine university. Many great military leaders of the 
20th century, from Dwight Eisenhower, to Colin Powell, studied on this campus. 
And today the National Defense University is training a new generation of 
leaders who will serve and defend this nation in a new century. Americans are 
grateful for your devotion to duty, and so is your Commander-in-Chief.I am honored that two influential 
and important members of the United States Congress have joined us. First, 
Senator Joe Lieberman, strong defender of freedom. Thank you for coming, 
Senator. And the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Congressman 
Duncan Hunter. Proud you're here, Dunc. Thanks for coming. In the midst of what 
we hope will be the final snow blizzard of 2005, I'm honored you two men slushed 
here to this event.I appreciate so very much Lieutenant 
General Michael Dunn and his wife, Pam, for greeting me and for serving our 
nation. I want to thank all the National Defense University students for being 
here. I appreciate the staff for joining us. I want to thank the members of the 
diplomatic corps who have come today. It is an honor to see you all again. I 
want to thank my fellow Americans for caring about the subject of peace, and 
that's what I'm here to discuss.We meet at a time of great 
consequence for the security of our nation, a time when the defense of freedom 
requires the advance of freedom, a time with echoes in our history.Twice in six decades, a sudden 
attack on the United States launched our country into a global conflict, and 
began a period of serious reflection on America's place in the world. The 
bombing of Pearl Harbor taught America that unopposed tyranny, even on far-away 
continents, could draw our country into a struggle for our own survival. And our 
reflection on that lesson led us to help build peaceful democracies in the ruins 
of tyranny, to unite free nations in the NATO Alliance, and to establish a firm 
commitment to peace in the Pacific that continues to this day.The attacks of September the 11th, 
2001 also revealed the outlines of a new world. In one way, that assault was the 
culmination of decades of escalating violence -- from the killing of U.S. 
Marines in Beirut, to the bombing at the World Trade Center, to the attacks on 
American embassies in Africa, to the attacks on the USS Cole. In another way, 
September the 11th provided a warning of future dangers -- of terror networks 
aided by outlaw regimes, and ideologies that incite the murder of the innocent, 
and biological and chemical and nuclear weapons that multiply destructive power.Like an earlier generation, America 
is answering new dangers with firm resolve. No matter how long it takes, no 
matter how difficult the task, we will fight the enemy, and lift the shadow of 
fear, and lead free nations to victory.Like an earlier generation, America 
is pursuing a clear strategy with our allies to achieve victory. Our immediate 
strategy is to eliminate terrorist threats abroad, so we do not have to face 
them here at home. The theory here is straightforward: terrorists are less 
likely to endanger our security if they are worried about their own security. 
When terrorists spend their days struggling to avoid death or capture, they are 
less capable of arming and training to commit new attacks. We will keep the 
terrorists on the run, until they have nowhere left to hide.In three and a half years, the 
United States and our allies have waged a campaign of global scale -- from the 
mountains of Afghanistan, to the border regions of Pakistan, to the Horn of 
Africa, to the islands of the Philippines, to the plains of North Central Iraq. 
The al Qaeda terror network that attacked our country still has leaders, but 
many of its top commanders have been removed. There are still governments that 
sponsor and harbor terrorists, but their number has declined. There are still 
regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction -- but no longer without attention 
and without consequence. Our country is still the target of terrorists who want 
to kill many, and intimidate us all. We will stay on the offensive against them, 
until the fight is won.Members of our military are 
undertaking difficult missions, in some of the most dangerous and desolate parts 
of the world. These volunteers know the risks they face, and they know the cause 
they serve. As one Marine sergeant put it, ""I never want my children to 
experience what we saw in New York, at the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania."" He 
said, ""If we can eliminate whatever threat we can on foreign soil, I would 
rather do it there than have it come [home] to us."" In this vital cause, some of 
our men and women in uniform have fallen, some have returned home with terrible 
injuries, and all who sacrifice will have the permanent gratitude of the United 
States of America.In this war on terror, America is 
not alone. Many governments have awakened to the dangers we share and have begun 
to take serious action. Global terror requires a global response, and America is 
more secure today because dozens of other countries have stepped up to the 
fight.We're more secure because Pakistani 
forces captured more than one hundred extremists across the country last year, 
including operatives who were plotting attacks against the United States. We're 
more secure because Britain arrested an al Qaeda operative who had provided 
detailed casing reports on American targets to senior al Qaeda leaders. We're 
more secure because German authorities arrested extremists who were planning 
attacks against U.S. and coalition targets in Iraq. We're more secure because 
the Philippines' new Anti-Terrorism Task Force has helped capture more than a 
dozen terrorist suspects -- including seven members of al Qaeda and affiliated 
networks. We're more secure because Poland is leading a 15-nation multi-national 
division in Iraq, and forces from 23 countries have given their lives in the 
struggle against terrorists and insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq.Our allies in the war on terror are 
making tough decisions, and they're taking risks, and they're losing lives. 
These countries have proven themselves trusted friends and reliable allies. So I 
urge the Congress to pass the Solidarity Initiative I have proposed to stand by 
the countries that are standing by us in the war on terror.Our strategy to keep the peace in 
the longer term is to help change the conditions that give rise to extremism and 
terror, especially in the broader Middle East. Parts of that region have been 
caught for generations in a cycle of tyranny and despair and radicalism. When a 
dictatorship controls the political life of a country, responsible opposition 
cannot develop, and dissent is driven underground and toward the extreme. And to 
draw attention away from their social and economic failures, dictators place 
blame on other countries and other races, and stir the hatred that leads to 
violence. This status quo of despotism and anger cannot be ignored or appeased, 
kept in a box or bought off, because we have witnessed how the violence in that 
region can reach easily across borders and oceans. The entire world has an 
urgent interest in the progress, and hope, and freedom in the broader Middle 
East.The advance of hope in the Middle 
East requires new thinking in the region. By now it should be clear that 
authoritarian rule is not the wave of the future; it is the last gasp of a 
discredited past. It should be clear that free nations escape stagnation, and 
grow stronger with time, because they encourage the creativity and enterprise of 
their people. It should be clear that economic progress requires political 
modernization, including honest representative government and the rule of law. 
And it should be clear that no society can advance with only half of its talent 
and energy -- and that demands the full participation of women.The advance of hope in the Middle 
East also requires new thinking in the capitals of great democracies -- 
including Washington, D.C. By now it should be clear that decades of excusing 
and accommodating tyranny, in the pursuit of stability, have only led to 
injustice and instability and tragedy. It should be clear that the advance of 
democracy leads to peace, because governments that respect the rights of their 
people also respect the rights of their neighbors. It should be clear that the 
best antidote to radicalism and terror is the tolerance and hope kindled in free 
societies. And our duty is now clear: For the sake of our long-term security, 
all free nations must stand with the forces of democracy and justice that have 
begun to transform the Middle East.Encouraging democracy in that region 
is a generational commitment. It's also a difficult commitment, demanding 
patience and resolve -- when the headlines are good and when the headlines 
aren't so good. Freedom has determined enemies, who show no mercy for the 
innocent, and no respect for the rules of warfare. Many societies in the region 
struggle with poverty and illiteracy, many rulers in the region have 
longstanding habits of control; many people in the region have deeply ingrained 
habits of fear.For all these reasons, the chances 
of democratic progress in the broader Middle East have seemed frozen in place 
for decades. Yet at last, clearly and suddenly, the thaw has begun. The people 
of Afghanistan have embraced free government, after suffering under one of the 
most backward tyrannies on earth. The voters in Iraq defied threats of murder, 
and have set their country on a path to full democracy. The people of the 
Palestinian Territories cast their ballots against violence and corruption of 
the past. And any who doubt the appeal of freedom in the Middle East can look to 
Lebanon, where the Lebanese people are demanding a free and independent nation. 
In the words of one Lebanese observer, ""Democracy is knocking at the door of 
this country and, if it's successful in Lebanon, it is going to ring the doors 
of every Arab regime.""Across the Middle East, a critical 
mass of events is taking that region in a hopeful new direction. Historic 
changes have many causes, yet these changes have one factor in common. A 
businessman in Beirut recently said, ""We have removed the mask of fear. We're 
not afraid anymore."" Pervasive fear is the foundation of every dictatorial 
regime -- the prop that holds up all power not based on consent. And when the 
regime of fear is broken, and the people find their courage and find their 
voice, democracy is their goal, and tyrants, themselves, have reason to fear.History is moving quickly, and 
leaders in the Middle East have important choices to make. The world community, 
including Russia and Germany and France and Saudi Arabia and the United States 
has presented the Syrian government with one of those choices -- to end its 
nearly 30-year occupation of Lebanon, or become even more isolated from the 
world. The Lebanese people have heard the speech by the Syrian president. 
They've seen these delaying tactics and half-measures before. The time has come 
for Syria to fully implement Security Council Resolution 1559. All Syrian 
military forces and intelligence personnel must withdraw before the Lebanese 
elections, for those elections to be free and fair.The elections in Lebanon must be 
fully and carefully monitored by international observers. The Lebanese people 
have the right to determine their future, free from domination by a foreign 
power. The Lebanese people have the right to choose their own parliament this 
spring, free of intimidation. And that new government will have the help of the 
international community in building sound political, economic, and military 
institutions, so the great nation of Lebanon can move forward in security and 
freedom.Today I have a message for the 
people of Lebanon: All the world is witnessing your great movement of 
conscience. Lebanon's future belongs in your hands, and by your courage, 
Lebanon's future will be in your hands. The American people are on your side. 
Millions across the earth are on your side. The momentum of freedom is on your 
side, and freedom will prevail in Lebanon.America and other nations are also 
aware that the recent terrorist attack in Tel Aviv was conducted by a radical 
Palestinian group headquartered in Damascus. Syria, as well as Iran, has a long 
history of supporting terrorist groups determined to sow division and chaos in 
the Middle East, and there is every possibility they will try this strategy 
again. The time has come for Syria and Iran to stop using murder as a tool of 
policy, and to end all support for terrorism.In spite of attacks by extremists, 
the world is seeing hopeful progress in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. There 
is only one outcome that will end the tyranny, danger, violence and 
hopelessness, and meet the aspirations of all people in the region: We seek two 
democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and 
security.And that goal is within reach, if 
all the parties meet their responsibilities and if terrorism is brought to an 
end. Arab states must end incitement in their own media, cut off public and 
private funding for terrorism, stop their support for extremist education, and 
establish normal relations with Israel. Israel must freeze settlement activity, 
help the Palestinians build a thriving economy, and ensure that a new 
Palestinian state is truly viable, with contiguous territory on the West Bank. 
Palestinian leaders must fight corruption, encourage free enterprise, rest true 
authority with the people, and actively confront terrorist groups.The bombing in Tel Aviv is a 
reminder that the fight against terrorists is critical to the search for peace 
and for Palestinian statehood. In an interview last week, Palestinian President 
Abbas strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, declaring, ""Ending 
violence and security chaos is first and foremost a Palestinian interest."" He 
went on to say, ""We cannot build the foundations of a state without the rule of 
law and public order.""President Abbas is correct. And so 
the United States will help the Palestinian Authority build the security 
services that current peace and future statehood require: security forces which 
are effective, responsive to civilian control, and dedicated to fighting terror 
and upholding the rule of law. We will coordinate with the government of Israel, 
with neighbors such as Egypt and Jordan, and with other donors to ensure that 
Palestinians get the training and equipment they need. The United States is 
determined to help the parties remove obstacles to progress and move forward in 
practical ways, so we can seize this moment for peace in the Holy Land.In other parts of the Middle East, 
we're seeing small but welcome steps. Saudi Arabia's recent municipal elections 
were the beginning of reform that may allow greater participation in the future. 
Egypt has now -- has now the prospect of competitive, multi-party elections for 
President in September. Like all free elections, these require freedom of 
assembly, multiple candidates, free access by those candidates to the media, and 
the right to form political parties. Each country in the Middle East will take a 
different path of reform. And every nation that starts on that journey can know 
that America will walk at its side.Progress in the Middle East is 
threatened by weapons of mass destruction and their proliferation. Today, Great 
Britain, France, and Germany are involved in a difficult negotiation with Iran 
aimed at stopping its nuclear weapons program. We want our allies to succeed, 
because we share the view that Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons would be 
destabilizing and threatening to all of Iran's neighbors. The Iranian regime 
should listen to the concerns of the world, and listen to the voice of the 
Iranian people, who long for their liberty and want their country to be a 
respected member of the international community. We look forward to the day when 
Iran joins in the hopeful changes taking place across the region. We look 
forward to the day when the Iranian people are free.Iran and other nations have an 
example in Iraq. The recent elections have begun a process of debate and 
coalition building unique in Iraqi history, and inspiring to see. Iraq's leaders 
are forming a government that will oversee the next -- and critical -- stage in 
Iraq's political transition: the writing of a permanent constitution. This 
process must take place without external influence. The shape of Iraq's 
democracy must be determined by the Iraqis, themselves.Iraq's democracy, in the long run, 
must also be defended by Iraqis, themselves. Our goal is to help Iraqi security 
forces move toward self-reliance, and they are making daily progress. Iraqi 
forces were the main providers of security at about 5,000 polling places in the 
January elections. Our coalition is providing equipment and training to the new 
Iraqi military, yet they bring a spirit all of their own.Last month, when soldiers of the 
U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment were on combat patrol north of Baghdad, one of their 
Humvees fell into a canal, and Iraqi troops came to their rescue -- plunging 
into the water again and again, until the last American was recovered. The Army 
colonel in charge of the unit said, ""When I saw those Iraqis in the water, 
fighting to save their American brothers, I saw a glimpse of the future of this 
country."" One of the Iraqi soldiers commented, ""These people have come a hundred 
-- 10,000 miles to help my country. They've left their families and their 
children. If we can give them something back, just a little, we can show our 
thanks."" America is proud to defend freedom in Iraq, and proud to stand with the 
brave Iraqis as they defend their own freedom.Three and a half years ago, the 
United States mourned our dead, gathered our resolve, and accepted a mission. We 
made a decision to stop threats to the American people before they arrive on our 
shores, and we have acted on that decision. We're also determined to seek and 
support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and 
culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.This objective will not be achieved 
easily, or all at once, or primarily by force of arms. We know that freedom, by 
definition, must be chosen, and that the democratic institutions of other 
nations will not look like our own. Yet we also know that our security 
increasingly depends on the hope and progress of other nations now simmering in 
despair and resentment. And that hope and progress is found only in the advance 
of freedom.This advance is a consistent theme 
of American strategy -- from the Fourteen Points, to the Four Freedoms, to the 
Marshall Plan, to the Reagan Doctrine. Yet the success of this approach does not 
depend on grand strategy alone. We are confident that the desire for freedom, 
even when repressed for generations, is present in every human heart.  And 
that desire can emerge with sudden power to change the course of history.Americans, of all people, should not 
be surprised by freedom's power. A nation founded on the universal claim of 
individual rights should not be surprised when other people claim those rights. 
Those who place their hope in freedom may be attacked and challenged, but they 
will not ultimately be disappointed, because freedom is the design of humanity 
and freedom is the direction of history.In our time, America has been 
attacked. America has been challenged. Yet the uncertainty, and sorrow, and 
sacrifice of these years have not been in vain. Millions have gained their 
liberty; and millions more have gained the hope of liberty that will not be 
denied. The trumpet of freedom has been sounded, and that trumpet never calls 
retreat.Before history is written in books, 
it is written in courage -- the courage of honorable soldiers; the courage of 
oppressed peoples; the courage of free nations in difficult tasks. Our 
generation is fortunate to live in a time of courage. And we are proud to serve 
in freedom's cause.May God bless you all",thank please seat great back fine university many great military leader century dwight eisenhower colin powell study campus today national defense university

58,31 January 2006,>George W. Bush - Fort Hood 2005 Addre,"AddressGeorgeW.BushAddress at Fort Hooddelivered 12 April 
2005, Fort Hood, TexasAudio mp3 of AddressPlug-in required for flash audioYour browser does not support the audio element.click 
for pdfThank you all for the warm welcome. It wasn't all that long ago that I 
		brought my family over to go to church Easter Sunday here at Fort Hood. 
		I've been looking forward to coming back and giving you a proper Army 
		greeting: Hoo-ah!  It's an honor to be with the courageous 
		men and women of the ""Phantom Corps.""The soldiers and families of Fort Hood have contributed mightily to our 
		efforts in the war on terror. Many of you have recently returned from 
		Iraq.  Welcome home -- and thank you for a job well-done.  
		Others are preparing to head out this fall --  some for a second 
		tour of duty.  Whether you're coming or going, you are making an 
		enormous difference for the security of our nation and for the peace of 
		the world. I want to thank you for defending your fellow citizens. I 
		want to thank you for extending liberty to millions. And I want to thank 
		you for making America proud.I especially want to thank the military families who are here today. I 
		want to thank you for your sacrifices in the war on terror. It isn't 
		easy being the one left behind when a loved one goes to war. You have a 
		wonderful community here at Fort Hood. I thank you for the support you 
		have given to each other. By loving and supporting a soldier, you are 
		also serving our nation. Americans are grateful for your sacrifice and 
		your service -- and so is your Commander-in-Chief.I want to thank Lieutenant General Tom Metz, and his wife, Pam. I want 
		to thank Command Sergeant Major Joe Gainey, and his lovely wife. I want 
		to thank all the officers and soldiers of this fantastic base.  
		I appreciate our fine Governor from the state of Texas, Governor Rick 
		Perry, for joining us today.  I want to thank Congressman 
		John Carter and Congressman Chet Edwards for joining us today.  I'm looking forward to giving them a ride back to Washington 
		on Air Force One.  I suspect they're looking forward to the 
		ride back.I want to thank Major General Pete Chiarelli for being with us today, 
		and his wife, Beth; Major General JD Thurman, and his wife, Dee; Command Sergeant Major Tom McMurtrie. And all the 
		soldiers, airmen, military families, veterans, friends of Fort Hood, and 
		the Three Corps.This weekend we marked the two-year anniversary of the liberation of 
		Baghdad.  Coalition forces crossed more than 350 miles of desert to 
		get there, pushing through dust storms and death squads. They reached 
		the Iraqi capital in 21 days, and that achievement will be studied for 
		generations as the fastest armored advance in military history.The coalition assault was rapid, and it wasn't easy. The enemy hid in 
		schools and hospitals. They used civilians as human shields. Yet our 
		troops persevered. We protected civilian lives while destroying the 
		Republican Guard's Medina Division, pushing through the Karbala Gap, 
		capturing Saddam International Airport, and, on April 9th, we liberated 
		the Iraqi capital.For millions of Iraqis and Americans, it is a day they will never 
		forget. The toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad will be 
		recorded, alongside the fall of the Berlin Wall, as one of the great 
		moments in the history of liberty. And eight months later, soldiers of 
		the Ivy Division brought the real Saddam Hussein to 
		justice.  When Ironhorse soldiers left for Iraq, Saddam Hussein was 
		a brutal dictator sitting in a palace, and by the time you came home, he 
		was sitting in a prison cell.When it came time to drive the terrorists and insurgents from Fallujah, 
		soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division spearheaded the assault. The ""First 
		Team"" was ""First in Fallujah"" -- and when the dust settled, what you 
		found there reminds us why we are at war: Blood-stained torture chambers 
		used by terrorists to execute hostages; you found videos of beheadings 
		and brutal terrorist attacks; you found over 600 improvised explosive 
		devices, including an ice cream truck that had been loaded with 
		bomb-making materials for a terrorist attack.The men and women of the Phantom Corps know why we are in Iraq. As one 
		First Team soldier, Lieutenant Mike Erwin, put it: ""If we can start to 
		change the most powerful country in the Middle East, the others will 
		follow, and Americans 20 years down the road won't have to deal with a 
		day like September the 11th, 2001.""The terrorists have made Iraq a central front in the war on terror. 
		Because of your service, because of your sacrifice, we are defeating 
		them there where they live, so we do not have to face them where we 
		live.  Because of you, the people of Iraq no longer live in 
		fear of being executed and left in mass graves. Because of you, freedom 
		is taking root in Iraq. Our success in Iraq will make America safer, for 
		us and for future generations.In my liberation message to the Iraqi people, I made them a solemn 
		promise: ""The government of Iraq, and the future of your country, will 
		soon belong to you."" I went on to say: ""We will help you build a 
		peaceful and representative government that protects the rights of all 
		citizens. And then our military forces will leave.""From 
		the beginning, our goal in Iraq has been to promote Iraqi independence 
		-- by helping the Iraqi people establish a free country that can sustain 
		itself, rule itself, and defend itself. And in the last two years, 
		Iraqis have made enormous progress toward that goal. Iraqis have laid 
		the foundations of a free society, with hundreds of independent 
		newspapers and dozens of political parties and associations, and schools 
		that teach Iraqi children how to read and write, instead of the 
		propaganda of Saddam Hussein. Iraqis have laid the foundation of a free 
		economy, with a new currency and independent central bank, new laws to 
		encourage foreign investment, and thousands of small businesses 
		established since liberation.The troops from Fort Hood have done their part. In Baghdad, soldiers of 
		the 1st Cavalry Division launched Operation Adam Smith, and the new 
		generation of Iraqi entrepreneurs you helped nurture will create jobs 
		and opportunities for millions of their fellow citizens. Iraqis have 
		laid the foundation for a society built on the rule of law. Today, 
		courts are functioning across Iraq, and hundreds of independent Iraqi 
		judges have been trained in Bahrain and Jordan and Czech Republic and 
		Britain and Italy.An Iraqi special tribunal has been established that will try senior 
		leadership, including Saddam Hussein.  He will get the trial 
		that he did not afford his fellow citizens when he was in power. Slowly 
		but surely, the land that gave civilization the first written code of 
		law is now restoring the rule of law, and setting the example for people 
		across the Middle East.Iraqis have laid a solid foundation for democratic self-government. The 
		world watched in awe as the Iraqi people defied the car bombers and 
		assassins to cast their votes in the country's first free and democratic 
		election in decades. It took courage, the kind of courage displayed by a 
		29-year-old Iraqi policeman named Abdul Amir. On election day, Amir 
		noticed a suspicious man walking toward the line of voters at a Baghdad 
		polling station. With complete disregard for his own safety, he threw 
		his arms around the man and dragged him into a nearby intersection, 
		where the man detonated the belt of explosives that was wrapped around 
		his body. Amir took the brunt of the blast, giving his own life to save 
		scores of innocent civilians. He is a hero of a free Iraq, and the world 
		honors his valor and his sacrifice.Because of brave Iraqis like Abdul Amir, today the free nation of Iraq 
		has elected a transitional assembly, a President and two Deputy 
		Presidents, leaders who answer to the people, instead of the other way 
		around.I've spoken with the new leaders of Iraq, President Talabani, as well as 
		Speaker -- Assembly Speaker al-Hassani. I congratulated them on their 
		achievement. I told them I look forward to working with the new 
		government that will soon be established. I assured them that the United 
		States will continue to stand with the Iraqi people as they take control 
		of their destiny and assume the blessings of self-government.There's a lot of hard work ahead. The Iraqi people face brutal and 
		determined enemies. But Iraqis are also determined, and they have the 
		will to defeat the insurgency. The soldiers and police of a free Iraq 
		learned on election day they can face down the insurgents, and they 
		learned they can prevail. The Iraqi people now have confidence that the 
		soldiers and police of a free Iraq have the courage and resolve to 
		defend them. The Iraqi security forces are fighting bravely for the 
		future of their country, and in the last six months alone, more than 800 
		have given their lives in the struggle.The soldiers of Fort Hood have seen their courage in action. Sergeant 
		First Class Troy Hawkins recently put it, ""The Iraqis will stand and 
		fight. I've seen guys with grenade fragments in them, bleeding, pulling 
		people off the street and getting kids out of the way. Then they'll 
		fight the enemy. They're determined to make this work."" And the United 
		States is determined to help the Iraqis succeed.As Iraq's new government assumes increasing responsibility for the 
		stability of their country, security operations are entering a new 
		phase. Iraq security forces are becoming more self-reliant and taking on 
		greater responsibilities. And that means that America and its coalition 
		partners are increasingly playing more of a supporting role. Today, more 
		than 150,000 Iraqi security forces have been trained and equipped, and 
		for the first time, the Iraqi army, police and security forces now 
		outnumber U.S. forces in Iraq.Like free people everywhere, Iraqis want to be defended and led by their 
		own countrymen. We will help them achieve this objective so Iraqis can 
		secure their own nation. And then our troops will come home with the 
		honor they have earned.The Iraqi people know the sacrifices you are making. They're grateful to 
		you. They are grateful to your families. One Iraqi army colonel put it 
		this way: ""These U.S. soldiers leave their wives and kids to come here 
		and give us freedom. We have to thank them for doing that for us."" You 
		are making possible the peace of Iraq, and you are making possible the 
		security of free nations. Yours is noble work, it's important work, and 
		I thank you for assuming your duty.As the Iraq democracy succeeds, that success is sending a message from 
		Beirut to Tehran that freedom can be the future of every nation. The 
		establishment of a free Iraq at the heart of the Middle East will be a 
		crushing defeat to the forces of tyranny and terror, and a watershed 
		event in the global democratic revolution.In the last two years, you have accomplished much, yet your work isn't 
		over. Freedom still faces dangerous adversaries. Terrorists still want 
		to attack our people. But they're losing. These terrorists are losing 
		the struggle because they're under constant pressure from our Armed 
		Forces, and they will remain under constant pressure from our Armed 
		Forces.  And they are losing the struggle because they are on 
		the wrong side of history. Across the broader Middle East, the tide of 
		freedom is surging. The people of Afghanistan have embraced free 
		government, after suffering under one of the most backward tyrannies on 
		Earth. The people of the Palestinian Territories cast their ballots 
		against violence and corruption of the past. The people of Lebanon are 
		rising up to demand their freedom and independence. Saudi Arabia has 
		held its first municipal elections in decades. Egypt is taking its first 
		steps on the path to democratic reform. A critical mass of events is 
		taking that region in a hopeful new direction. And as freedom spreads in 
		the Middle East and beyond, the American people will be safer and the 
		free world more secure.You have fought the battles in the war on terror, and you have served 
		the cause of freedom. And you can be proud of all that you have 
		achieved.This time of brave achievement is also a time of sacrifice. Many of our 
		soldiers have returned from war with grave wounds that they will carry 
		with them the rest of their lives. And America will fulfill its duty by 
		providing them the best medical care possible. Still others have given 
		their lives in this struggle -- your friends, your comrades. We honor 
		their memory. We lift them up in prayer. Their sacrifice will always be 
		remembered by a grateful nation.  We can live as free people 
		because men and women like you have stepped forward and have volunteered 
		to serve.I came here today to thank you in person for your courageous choice of 
		service. You're making America proud. You're making America free. And 
		you're making the world more peaceful. I want to thank you for all 
		you've done for our great nation. May God bless you and your families. 
		And may God continue to bless this great land of liberty, the United 
		States of America.",fort hooddelivered april fort hood texasaudio require flash audioyour browser support audio pdfthank warm welcome long ago bring family go church easter sunday fort hood look

59,15 May 2006,>American Rhetoric: George W. Bush: Calvin College Commencement Addre,"Thank you, President 
Byker; members of the faculty; distinguished guests; parents, friends, 
family -- and, most importantly, the Class of 2005.Thanks for having 
me. I was excited to come back to Calvin, and I was just telling Laura the other 
night about what fun it would be to come to Calvin College. And I said, you know, 
""Laura, I love being around so many young folks. You know, it gives me a chance 
to re-live my glory days in academia."" She said, ""George, that's not exactly how I 
would describe your college experience."" She also said one other thing I think 
the graduates will appreciate hearing, good piece of advice. She said, the 
folks here are here to get their diploma, not to hear from an old guy go on too 
long. So with that sage advice, here goes.I bring a great message of 
hope and freedom to Calvin College Class of 2005: There's life after Professor 
Vanden Bosch and English 101. Someday you will appreciate the grammar and verbal 
skills you learned here. And if any of you wonder how far a mastery of the 
English language can take you, just look what it did for me.I thank the moms and dads 
here for your sacrifice and for your love. I want to thank the faculty for your 
hard work and dedication. And, again, I congratulate the Class of 2005. Soon -- 
soon you 
will collect your degrees and say goodbyes to a school that has been your home, and you will take your rightful place in a country that offers you the 
greatest freedom and opportunity on Earth. I ask that you use what you've 
learned here to make your own contributions to the story of American freedom.The immigrants who founded 
Calvin College came to America for the freedom to worship, and they built this 
great school on the sturdy ground of liberty. They saw in the American 
""experiment"" the world's best hope for freedom -- and they weren't the only ones 
excited about what they saw. In 1835, a young civil servant and aristocrat from 
France, named Alexis de Tocqueville, would publish a book about America that 
still resonates today.The book is called 
""Democracy in America,"" and in it this young Frenchman said that the secret to 
America's success was our talent for bringing people together for the common 
good. De Tocqueville wrote that tyrants maintained their power by ""isolating"" 
their citizens -- and that Americans guaranteed their freedom by their 
remarkable ability to band together without any direction from government. The 
America he described offered the world something it had never seen before: a 
working model of a thriving democracy where opportunity was unbounded, where 
virtue was strong, and where citizens took responsibility for their neighbors.Tocqueville's 
account is not just the observations of one man -- it is the story of our 
founding. It's not just a description of America at a point in time -- it is an 
agenda for our time. Our Founders rejected both a radical individualism that 
makes no room for others, and the dreary collectivism that crushes the 
individual. They gave us instead a society where individual freedom is anchored 
in communities. And in this hopeful new century, we have a great goal: to renew 
this spirit of community and thereby renew the character and compassion of our 
country.First, we must understand 
that the character of our citizens is essential to society. In a free and 
compassionate society, the public good depends on private character. That 
character is formed and shaped in institutions like family, faith, and the many 
civil and -- social and civic organizations, from the Boy Scouts to the  
Rotary Clubs. The future success of our nation depends on our ability to 
understand the difference between right and wrong and to have the strength of 
character to make the right choices. Government cannot create character, but it 
can and should respect and support the institutions that do.Second, we must understand 
the importance of keeping power close to the people. Local people know local 
problems, they know the names and faces of their neighbors. The heart and soul 
of America is in our local communities; it is in the citizen school boards that 
determine how our children are educated; it's in city councils and state 
legislators that reflect the unique needs and priorities of the people they 
serve; it's in the volunteer groups that transform towns and cities into caring 
communities and neighborhoods. In the years to come, I hope that you'll consider 
joining these associations or serving in government -- because when you come 
together to serve a cause greater than yourself, you will energize your 
communities and you will help build a more just and compassionate America.Finally, we must 
understand that it is by becoming active in our communities that we move beyond 
our narrow interests. In today's complex world, there are a lot of things that 
pull us apart. We need to support and encourage the institutions and pursuits 
that bring us together. And we learn how to come together by participating in 
our churches and temples and mosques and synagogues; in civil rights 
associations; in our PTAs and Jaycees; in our gardening and book clubs, interest 
groups and chambers of commerce; in our service groups -- from soup kitchens to 
homeless shelters.All these 
organizations promote the spirit of community and help us acquire the ""habits of 
heart"" that are so vital to a free society. And because one of the deepest 
values of our country is compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen 
who feels isolated from the opportunities of America. Our faith-based and 
community groups provide the armies of compassion that help people who wonder if 
the American Dream is meant for them. These armies of compassion are the great 
engines of social change. They serve individual and local needs, and they have 
been found at the front of every great movement in American history.The history of forming 
associations dedicated to serving others is as old as America, itself. From 
abolition societies and suffrage movements to immigrant aid groups and prison 
reform ministries, America's social entrepreneurs have often been far ahead of 
our government in identifying and meeting the needs of our fellow countrymen. 
Because they are closer to the people they serve, our faith-based and community 
organizations deliver better results than government. And they have a human 
touch: When a person in need knocks on the door of a faith-based or community 
organization, he or she is welcomed as a brother or a sister.No one understood this 
better than another 19th century visitor to America whose name is well known to 
Calvin College: Abraham Kuyper. Kuyper was a Dutchman who would be elected his 
nation's prime minister, and he knew all about the importance of associations 
because he founded so many of them -- including two newspapers, a political 
party, and a university. Kuyper contrasted the humanizing influence of 
independent social institutions with the ""mechanical character of government."" 
And in a famous speech right here in Grand Rapids, he urged Dutch immigrants to 
resist the temptation to retreat behind their own walls. He told them to go 
out into their adopted America and make a true difference as true Christian 
citizens.Our government is 
encouraging all Americans to make a difference through our faith-based and 
community initiative; we're mobilizing Americans to volunteer through the USA 
Freedom Corps. We'll do our part, but, ultimately, service is up to you. It is 
your choice to make. As your generation takes its place in the world, all of you 
must make this decision: Will you be a spectator or a citizen? To make a 
difference in this world, you must be involved. By serving a higher calling here 
or abroad, you'll make your lives richer and build a more hopeful future for our 
world.At Calvin College, you 
take this call to service to heart. You serve as ""agents of renewal"" across the 
Earth. You volunteer for Big Brothers/Big Sisters to mentor young people. You 
work at Bethany Christian Services here in Grand Rapids, one of the best-known 
adoption services in America. A former Calvin student and professor, Vern 
Ehlers, serves in the halls of Congress. As the Class of 2005 goes out into the 
world, I ask you to embrace this tradition of service and help set an example 
for all Americans. As Americans we share an agenda that calls us to action -- a 
great responsibility to serve and love others, a responsibility that goes back 
to the greatest commandment.This isn't a Democrat 
idea. This isn't a Republican idea. This is an American idea. It has sustained 
our nation's liberty for more than 200 years. The Founders knew that too much 
government leads to oppression, but that too little government can leave us 
helpless and alone. So they built a free society with many roots in community. 
And to keep the tree of liberty standing tall in the century before us, you must 
nourish those roots.Today, the Calvin Class of 
2005 looks out on an America that continues to be defined by the promise of our 
Declaration of Independence. We're [still] the nation our Founders imagined, where 
individual freedom and opportunity is unbounded, where community is vibrant, 
where compassion keeps us from resting until all our citizens take their place 
at the banquet of freedom and equality. And with your help, we'll all do our 
part to transform our great land one person and one community at a time.Thank you for having me 
and may God bless you, and may God continue to bless our country.",thank president byker member faculty distinguish guest parent friend family importantly class excite come back calvin tell laura

60,06 September 2006,">American Rhetoric: George W. Bush - Hurricane Disaster Relief Speech to 
the Nati","Good evening. I'm speaking to you from the city of New Orleans -- nearly empty, 
still partly under water, and waiting for life and hope to return. Eastward from 
Lake Pontchartrain, across the Mississippi coast, to Alabama into Florida, 
millions of lives were changed in a day by a cruel and wasteful storm.In 
the aftermath, we have seen fellow citizens left stunned and uprooted, searching 
for loved ones, and grieving for the dead, and looking for meaning in a tragedy 
that seems so blind and random. We've also witnessed the kind of desperation no 
citizen of this great and generous nation should ever have to know -- fellow 
Americans calling out for food and water, vulnerable people left at the mercy of 
criminals who had no mercy, and the bodies of the dead lying uncovered and 
untended in the street.These days of sorrow and outrage have also been marked by acts of courage and 
kindness that make all Americans proud. Coast Guard and other personnel rescued 
tens of thousands of people from flooded neighborhoods. Religious congregations 
and families have welcomed strangers as brothers and sisters and neighbors. In 
the community of Chalmette, when two men tried to break into a home, the owner 
invited them to stay -- and took in 15 other people who had no place to go. At 
Tulane Hospital for Children, doctors and nurses did not eat for days so 
patients could have food, and eventually carried the patients on their backs up 
eight flights of stairs to helicopters.Many first responders were victims themselves, wounded healers, with a sense of 
duty greater than their own suffering. When I met Steve Scott of the Biloxi Fire 
Department, he and his colleagues were conducting a house-to-house search for 
survivors. Steve told me this, ""I lost my house and I lost my cars, but I still 
got my family, and I still got my spirit.""Across the Gulf Coast, among people who have lost much, and suffered much, and 
given to the limit of their power, we are seeing that same spirit -- a core of 
strength that survives all hurt, a faith in God no storm can take away, and a 
powerful American determination to clear the ruins and build better than before.Tonight so many victims of the hurricane and the flood are far from home and 
friends and familiar things. You need to know that our whole nation cares about 
you, and in the journey ahead you're not alone. To all who carry a burden of 
loss, I extend the deepest sympathy of our country. To every person who has 
served and sacrificed in this emergency, I offer the gratitude of our country. 
And tonight I also, also offer this pledge of 
the American people: Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what 
it takes, we will stay as long as it takes, to help citizens rebuild their 
communities and their lives. And all who question the future of the Crescent 
City need to know there is no way to imagine America without New Orleans, and 
this great city will rise again.The work of rescue is largely finished; the work of recovery is moving forward. 
In nearly all of Mississippi, electric power has been restored. Trade is 
starting to return to the Port of New Orleans, and agricultural shipments are 
moving down the Mississippi River. All major gasoline pipelines are now in 
operation, preventing the supply disruptions that many feared. The breaks in the 
levees have been closed, the pumps are running, and the water here in New 
Orleans is receding by the hour. Environmental officials are on the ground, 
taking water samples, identifying and dealing with hazardous debris, and working 
to get drinking water and waste water treatment systems operating again. And 
some very sad duties are being carried out by professionals who gather the dead, 
treat them with respect, and prepare them for their rest.In 
the task of recovery and rebuilding, some of the hardest work is still ahead, 
and it will require the creative skill and generosity of a united country.Our first commitment is to meet the immediate needs of those who had to flee 
their homes and leave all their possessions behind. For these Americans, every 
night brings uncertainty, every day requires new courage, and in the months to 
come will bring more than their fair share of struggles.The Department of Homeland Security is registering evacuees who are now in 
shelters and churches, or private homes, whether in the Gulf region or far away. 
I have signed an order providing immediate assistance to people from the 
disaster area. As of today, more than 500,000 evacuee families have gotten 
emergency help to pay for food, clothing, and other essentials. Evacuees who 
have not yet  (registered? 5:38) registered should contact FEMA or the Red 
Cross. We need to know who you are, because many of you will be eligible for 
broader assistance in the future. Many families were separated during the 
evacuation, and we are working to help you reunite. Please call this number: 
1-877-568-3317 -- that's 1-877-568-3317 -- and we will work to bring your family 
back together, and pay for your travel to reach them.In 
addition, we're taking steps to ensure that evacuees do not have to travel great 
distances or navigate bureaucracies to get the benefits that are there for them. 
The Department of Health and Human Services has sent more than 1,500 health 
professionals, along with over 50 tons of medical supplies -- including vaccines 
and antibiotics and medicines for people with chronic conditions such as 
diabetes. The Social Security Administration is delivering checks. The 
Department of Labor is helping displaced persons apply for temporary jobs and 
unemployment benefits. And the Postal Service is registering new addresses so 
that people can get their mail.To 
carry out the first stages of the relief effort and begin rebuilding at once, I 
have asked for, and the Congress has provided, more than $60 billion dollars. 
This is an unprecedented response to an unprecedented crisis, which demonstrates 
the compassion and resolve of our nation.Our second commitment is to help the citizens of the Gulf Coast to overcome this 
disaster, put their lives back together, and rebuild their communities. Along 
this coast, for mile after mile, the wind and water swept the land clean. In 
Mississippi, many thousands of houses were damaged or destroyed. In New Orleans 
and surrounding parishes, more than a quarter-million houses are no longer safe 
to live in. Hundreds of thousands of people from across this region will need to 
find longer-term housing.Our goal is to get people out of the shelters by the middle of October. So we're 
providing direct assistance to evacuees that allows them to rent apartments, and 
many already are moving into places of their own. A number of states have taken 
in evacuees and shown them great compassion -- admitting children to school, and 
providing health care. So I will work with the Congress to ensure that states 
are reimbursed for these extra expenses.In 
the disaster area, and in cities that have received huge numbers of displaced 
people, we're beginning to bring in mobile homes and trailers for temporary use. 
To relieve the burden on local health care facilities in the region, we're 
sending extra doctors and nurses to these areas. We're also providing money that 
can be used to cover overtime pay for police and fire departments while the 
cities and towns rebuild.Near New Orleans, Biloxi, and other cities, housing is urgently needed for 
police and firefighters, other service providers, and the many workers who are 
going to rebuild these cities. Right now, many are sleeping on ships we have 
brought to the Port of New Orleans -- and more ships are on their way to the 
region. And we'll provide mobile homes, and supply them with basic services, as 
close to construction areas as possible, so the rebuilding process can go 
forward as quickly as possible.And the federal government will undertake a close partnership with the states of 
Louisiana and Mississippi, the city of New Orleans, and other Gulf Coast cities, 
so they can rebuild in a sensible, well-planned way. Federal funds will cover 
the great majority of the costs of repairing public infrastructure in the 
disaster zone, from roads and bridges to schools and water systems. Our goal is 
to get the work done quickly. And taxpayers expect this work to be done honestly 
and wisely -- so we'll have a team of inspectors general reviewing all 
expenditures.In 
the rebuilding process, there will be many important decisions and many details 
to resolve, yet we're moving forward according to some clear principles. The 
federal government will be fully engaged in the mission, but Governor Barbour, 
Governor Blanco, Mayor Nagin, and other state and local leaders will have the 
primary role in planning for their own future. Clearly, communities will need to 
move decisively to change zoning laws and building codes, in order to avoid a 
repeat of what we've seen. And in the work of rebuilding, as many jobs as 
possible should go to the men and women who live in Louisiana, Mississippi, and 
Alabama.Our third commitment is this: When communities are rebuilt, they must be even 
better and stronger than before the storm. Within the Gulf region are some of 
the most beautiful and historic places in America. As all of us saw on 
television, there's also some deep, persistent poverty in this region as well. 
That poverty has roots in a history of racial discrimination, which cut off 
generations from the opportunity of America. We have a duty to confront this 
poverty with bold action. So let us restore all that we have cherished from 
yesterday, and let us rise above the legacy of inequality. When the streets are 
rebuilt, there should be many new businesses, including minority-owned 
businesses, along those streets. When the houses are rebuilt, more families 
should own, not rent, those houses. When the regional economy revives, local 
people should be prepared for the jobs being created.Americans want the Gulf Coast not just to survive, but to thrive; not just to 
cope, but to overcome. We want evacuees to come home, for the best of reasons -- 
because they have a real chance at a better life in a place they love.When one resident of this city who lost his home was asked by a reporter if he 
would relocate, he said, ""Naw, I will rebuild -- but I will build higher."" That 
is our vision for the future, in this city and beyond. We'll not just rebuild, 
we'll build higher and better. To meet this goal, I will listen to good ideas 
from Congress, and state and local officials, and the private sector. I believe 
we should start with three initiatives that the Congress should pass.Tonight I propose the creation of a Gulf Opportunity Zone, encompassing the 
region of the disaster in Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama. Within this 
zone, we should provide immediate incentives for job-creating investment, tax 
relief for small businesses, incentives to companies that create jobs, and loans 
and loan guarantees for small businesses, including minority-owned enterprises, 
to get them up and running again. It is entrepreneurship that creates jobs and 
opportunity; it is entrepreneurship that helps break the cycle of poverty; and 
we will take the side of entrepreneurs as they lead the economic revival of the 
Gulf region.I 
propose the creation of Worker Recovery Accounts to help those evacuees who need 
extra help finding work. Under this plan, the federal government would provide 
accounts of up to $5,000, which these evacuees could draw upon for job training 
and education to help them get a good job, and for child care expenses during 
their job search.And to help lower-income citizens in the hurricane region build new and better 
lives, I also propose that Congress pass an Urban Homesteading Act. Under this 
approach, we will identify property in the region owned by the federal 
government, and provide building sites to low-income citizens free of charge, 
through a lottery. In return, they would pledge to build on the lot, with either 
a mortgage or help from a charitable organization like Habitat for Humanity. 
Home ownership is one of the great strengths of any community, and it must be a 
central part of our vision for the revival of this region.In 
the long run, the New Orleans area has a particular challenge, because much of 
the city lies below sea level. The people who call it home need to have 
reassurance that their lives will be safer in the years to come. Protecting a 
city that sits lower than the water around it is not easy, but it can, and has 
been done. City and parish officials in New Orleans, and state officials in 
Louisiana will have a large part in the engineering decisions to come. And the 
Army Corps of Engineers will work at their side to make the flood protection 
system stronger than it has ever been.The work that has begun in the Gulf Coast region will be one of the largest 
reconstruction efforts the world has ever seen. When that job is done, all 
Americans will have something to be very proud of -- and all Americans are 
needed in this common effort. It is the armies of compassion -- charities and 
houses of worship, and idealistic men and women -- that give our reconstruction 
effort its humanity. They offer to those who hurt a friendly face, an arm around 
the shoulder, and the reassurance that in hard times, they can count on someone 
who cares. By land, by sea, and by air, good people wanting to make a difference 
deployed to the Gulf Coast, and they've been working around the clock ever 
since.The cash needed to support the armies of compassion is great, and Americans have 
given generously. For example, the private fundraising effort led by former 
Presidents Bush and Clinton has already received pledges of more than $100 
million dollars. Some of that money is going to the Governors to be used for 
immediate needs within their states. A portion will also be sent to local houses 
of worship to help reimburse them for the expense of helping others. This 
evening the need is still urgent, and I ask the American people to continue 
donating to the Salvation Army, the Red Cross, other good charities, and 
religious congregations in the region.It's also essential for the many organizations of our country to reach out to 
your fellow citizens in the Gulf area. So I've asked USA Freedom Corps to create 
an information clearinghouse, available at usafreedomcorps.gov, so that families 
anywhere in the country can find opportunities to help families in the region, 
or a school can support a school. And I challenge existing organizations -- 
churches, and Scout troops, or labor union locals to get in touch with their 
counterparts in Mississippi, Louisiana, or Alabama, and learn what they can do 
to help. In this great national enterprise, important work can be done by 
everyone, and everyone should find their role and do their part.The government of this nation will do its part, as well. Our cities must have 
clear and up-to-date plans for responding to natural disasters, and disease 
outbreaks, or a terrorist attack, for evacuating large numbers of people in an 
emergency, and for providing the food and water and security they would need. In 
a time of terror threats and weapons of mass destruction, the danger to our 
citizens reaches much wider than a fault line or a flood plain. I consider 
detailed emergency planning to be a national security priority, and therefore, 
I've ordered the Department of Homeland Security to undertake an immediate 
review, in cooperation with local counterparts, of emergency plans in every 
major city in America.I 
also want to know all the facts about the government response to Hurricane 
Katrina. The storm involved a massive flood, a major supply and security 
operation, and an evacuation order affecting more than a million people. It was 
not a normal hurricane -- and the normal disaster relief system was not equal to 
it. Many of the men and women of the Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, the United States military, the National Guard, Homeland 
Security, and state and local governments performed skillfully under the worst 
conditions. Yet the system, at every level of government, was not 
well-coordinated, and was overwhelmed in the first few days. It is now clear 
that a challenge on this scale requires greater federal authority and a broader 
role for the armed forces -- the institution of our government most capable of 
massive logistical operations on a moment's notice.Four years after the frightening experience of September the 11th, Americans 
have every right to expect a more effective response in a time of emergency. 
When the federal government fails to meet such an obligation, I, as President, 
am responsible for the problem, and for the solution. So I've ordered every 
Cabinet Secretary to participate in a comprehensive review of the government 
response to the hurricane. This government will learn the lessons of Hurricane 
Katrina. We're going to review every action and make necessary changes, so that 
we are better prepared for any challenge of nature, or act of evil men, that 
could threaten our people.The United States Congress also has an important oversight function to perform. 
Congress is preparing an investigation, and I will work with members of both 
parties to make sure this effort is thorough.In 
the life of this nation, we have often been reminded that nature is an awesome 
force, and that all life is fragile. We're the heirs of men and women who lived 
through those first terrible winters at Jamestown and Plymouth, who rebuilt 
Chicago after a great fire, and San Francisco after a great earthquake, who 
reclaimed the prairie from the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Every time, the people of 
this land have come back from fire, flood, and storm to build anew -- and to 
build better than what we had before. Americans have never left our destiny to 
the whims of nature -- and we will not start now.These trials have also reminded us that we are often stronger than we know -- 
with the help of grace and one another. They remind us of a hope beyond all pain 
and death, a God who welcomes the lost to a house not made with hands. And they 
remind us that we're tied together in this life, in this nation -- and that the 
despair of any touches us all.I 
know that when you sit on the steps of a porch where a home once stood, or sleep 
on a cot in a crowded shelter, it is hard to imagine a bright future. But that 
future will come. The streets of Biloxi and Gulfport will again be filled with 
lovely homes and the sound of children playing. The churches of Alabama will 
have their broken steeples mended and their congregations whole. And here in New 
Orleans, the street cars will once again rumble down St. Charles, and the 
passionate soul of a great city will return.In 
this place, there's a custom for the funerals of jazz musicians. The funeral 
procession parades slowly through the streets, followed by a band playing a 
mournful dirge as it moves to the cemetery. Once the casket has been laid in 
place, the band breaks into a joyful ""second line"" -- symbolizing the triumph of 
the spirit over death. Tonight the Gulf Coast is still coming through the dirge 
-- yet we will live to see the second line.Thank you, and may God bless America.",good even speak city new orleans nearly empty still partly water wait life hope return eastward lake pontchartrain

61,11 September 2006,>George W. Bush - NIH Speech on National Strategy for Avian Flu Pandemic (text-vide,"National Strategy for Avian Flu Pandemic (text-video)GeorgeW.BushNIH Address on Flu Pandemic Strategydelivered 1 
November 2005, Bethesda, MarylandThank you all. Michael, thank you very much for 
your introduction. And thanks for the warm reception here at the National 
Institute of Health. It's good to be back here again.For more than a century, the NIH has been at the 
forefront of this country's efforts to prevent, detect and treat disease, and I 
appreciate the good work you're doing here. This is an important facility, an 
important complex, and the people who work here are really important to the 
security of this nation. The scientists who have been supported by the folks who 
work here have developed and improved vaccines for meningitis and whooping cough 
and measles and mumps and rubella and chickenpox, and other infectious diseases. 
Because of the revolutionary advances in medicine pioneered with the help of the 
NIH, Americans no longer fear these dreaded diseases -- many lives have been 
saved.At this moment, the men and women of the NIH are 
working to protect the American people from another danger -- the risk of avian 
and pandemic influenza. Today, I have come to talk about our nation's efforts to 
address this vital issue to the health and the safety of all Americans. I'm here 
to discuss our strategy to prevent and protect the American people from a 
possible outbreak.I appreciate members of my Cabinet who are here. 
More importantly, I appreciate the hard work you've done on this issue. 
Secretary Rice, Secretary Johanns, Secretary Mineta, Secretary Nicholson, 
Secretary Chertoff. I appreciate the fact that Dr. J.W. Lee, Director-General of 
the World Health Organization has joined us. Dr. Lee, thank you for being here.I want to recognize Dr. David Nabarro, the Senior 
United Nations System Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza. Thanks for 
being here. This is -- you're about to hear me talk about an international scope 
of response and detection necessary to protect not only our own people, but 
people around the world. And the fact that these two gentlemen are here is an 
important signal.I want to thank Dr. Elias Zerhouni, he's the 
Director of the NIH; doing a fine job. I want to thank Julie Gerberding, who's 
the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I appreciate Dr. 
Rich Carmona, U.S. Surgeon General. Dr. Tony Fauci, Director of the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. I want to thank Dr. Bruce Gellin, 
Director of the National Vaccine Program Office. I want to thank Dr. Andy von 
Eschenbach, who is the Acting Director of the FDA and the Director of the 
National Cancer Institute.I appreciate all the members of the health care 
community who have joined us today. I want to thank state and local officials 
who are here. I particularly want to thank Senators Specter and Kennedy for 
coming, as well as Congressmen Linder, Burgess and Price. I appreciate you all 
taking time to be here.Most Americans are familiar with the influenza or 
the ""flu"" as a respiratory illness that makes hundreds of thousands of people 
sick every year. This fall as the flu season approaches, millions of our fellow 
citizens are once again visiting their doctors for their annual flu shot. I had 
mine. For most, it's just simply a precautionary measure to avoid the fever or a 
sore throat or muscle aches that come with the flu. Seasonal flu is extremely 
dangerous for some -- people whose immune systems have been weakened by age or 
illness. But it is not usually life-threatening for most healthy people.Pandemic flu is another matter. Pandemic flu 
occurs when a new strain of influenza emerges that can be transmitted easily 
from person to person -- and for which there is little or no natural immunity. 
Unlike seasonal flu, most people have not built up resistance to it. And unlike 
seasonal flu, it can kill those who are young and the healthy as well as those 
who are frail and sick.At this moment, there is no pandemic influenza in 
the United States or the world. But if history is our guide, there is reason to 
be concerned. In the last century, our country and the world have been hit by 
three influenza pandemics -- and viruses from birds contributed to all of them. 
The first, which struck in 1918, killed over half-a-million Americans and more 
than 20 million people across the globe. One-third of the U.S. population was 
infected, and life expectancy in our country was reduced by 13 years. The 1918 
pandemic was followed by pandemics in 1957 and 1968 which killed tens of 
thousands of Americans, and millions across the world.Three years ago, the world had a preview of the 
disruption an influenza pandemic can cause, when a previously unknown virus 
called SARS appeared in rural China. When an infected doctor carried the virus 
out of China, it spread to Vietnam and Singapore and Canada within a month. 
Before long, the SARS virus had spread to nearly 30 countries on six continents. 
It infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800. One elderly woman 
brought the virus from Hong Kong to Toronto, where it quickly spread to her son 
and then to others. Eventually, four others arrived with the virus and hundreds 
of Canadians fell ill with SARS, and dozens died.By one estimate, the SARS outbreak cost the 
Asian-Pacific region about $40 billion. The airline industry was hit 
particularly hard, with air travel to Asia dropping 45 percent in the year after 
the outbreak. All this was caused by a limited outbreak of a virus that infected 
thousands and lasted about six months. A global influenza pandemic that infects 
millions and lasts from one to three years could be far worse.Scientists and doctors cannot tell us where or 
when the next pandemic will strike, or how severe it will be, but most agree: at 
some point, we are likely to face another pandemic. And the scientific community 
is increasingly concerned by a new influenza virus known as H5N1 -- or avian flu 
-- that is now spreading through bird populations across Asia, and has recently 
reached Europe.This new strain of influenza has infected 
domesticated birds like ducks and chickens, as well as long-range migratory 
birds. In 1997, the first recorded outbreak among people took place in Hong 
Kong, when 18 people became infected and six died from the disease. Public 
health officials in the region took aggressive action and successfully contained 
the spread of the virus. Avian flu struck again in late 2003, and has infected 
over 120 people in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia, and killed more 
than 60 -- that's a fatality rate of about 50 percent.At this point, we do not have evidence that a 
pandemic is imminent. Most of the people in Southeast Asia who got sick were 
handling infected birds. And while the avian flu virus has spread from Asia to 
Europe, there are no reports of infected birds, animals, or people in the United 
States. Even if the virus does eventually appear on our shores in birds, that 
does not mean people in our country will be infected. Avian flu is still 
primarily an animal disease. And as of now, unless people come into direct, 
sustained contact with infected birds, it is unlikely they will come down with 
avian flu.While avian flu has not yet acquired the ability 
to spread easily from human to human, there is still cause for vigilance. The 
virus has developed some characteristics needed to cause a pandemic: It has 
demonstrated the ability to infect human beings, and it has produced a fatal 
illness in humans. If the virus were to develop the capacity for sustained 
human-to-human transmission, it could spread quickly across the globe.Our country has been given fair warning of this 
danger to our homeland -- and time to prepare. It's my responsibility as 
President to take measures now to protect the American people from the 
possibility that human-to-human transmission may occur. So several months ago, I 
directed all relevant departments and agencies in the federal government to take 
steps to address the threat of avian and pandemic flu. Since that time, my 
administration has developed a comprehensive national strategy, with concrete 
measures we can take to prepare for an influenza pandemic.Today, I am announcing key elements of that 
strategy. Our strategy is designed to meet three critical goals: First, we must 
detect outbreaks that occur anywhere in the world; second, we must protect the 
American people by stockpiling vaccines and antiviral drugs, and improve our 
ability to rapidly produce new vaccines against a pandemic strain; and, third, 
we must be ready to respond at the federal, state and local levels in the event 
that a pandemic reaches our shores.To meet these three goals, our strategy will 
require the combined efforts of government officials in public health, medical, 
veterinary and law enforcement communities and the private sector. It will 
require the active participation of the American people. And it will require the 
immediate attention of the United States Congress so we can have the resources 
in place to begin implementing this strategy right away.The first part of our strategy is to detect 
outbreaks before they spread across the world. In the fight against avian and 
pandemic flu, early detection is our first line of defense. A pandemic is a lot 
like a forest fire: if caught early, it might be extinguished with limited 
damage; if allowed to smolder undetected, it can grow to an inferno that spreads 
quickly beyond our ability to control it. So we're taking immediate steps to 
ensure early warning of an avian or pandemic flu outbreak among animals or 
humans anywhere in the world.In September at the United Nations, I announced a 
new International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza -- a global 
network of surveillance and preparedness that will help us to detect and respond 
quickly to any outbreaks of disease. The partnership requires participating 
countries that face an outbreak to immediately share information and provide 
samples to the World Health Organization. By requiring transparency, we can 
respond more rapidly to dangerous outbreaks.Since we announced this global initiative, the 
response from across the world has been very positive. Already, 88 countries and 
nine international organizations have joined the effort. Senior officials from 
participating governments recently convened the partnership's first meeting here 
in Washington.Together, we're working to control and monitor 
avian flu in Asia, and to ensure that all nations have structures in place to 
recognize and report outbreaks before they spread beyond human control. I've 
requested $251 million from Congress to help our foreign partners train local 
medical personnel, expand their surveillance and testing capacity, draw up 
preparedness plans, and take other vital actions to detect and contain 
outbreaks. 
A flu pandemic would have global consequences, so no nation can afford to ignore 
this threat, and every nation has responsibilities to detect and stop its 
spread.Here in the United States, we're doing our part. 
To strengthen domestic surveillance, my administration is launching the National 
Bio-surveillance Initiative. This initiative will help us rapidly detect, 
quantify and respond to outbreaks of disease in humans and animals, and deliver 
information quickly to state, and local, and national and international public 
health officials. By creating systems that provide continuous situational 
awareness, we're more likely to be able to stop, slow, or limit the spread of 
the pandemic and save American lives.The second part of our strategy is to protect the 
American people by stockpiling vaccines and antiviral drugs, and accelerating 
development of new vaccine technologies. One of the challenges presented by a 
pandemic is that scientists need a sample of the new strain before they can 
produce a vaccine against it. This means it is difficult to produce a pandemic 
vaccine before the pandemic actually appears -- and so there may not be a 
vaccine capable of fully immunizing our citizens from the new influenza virus 
during the first several months of a pandemic.To help protect our citizens during these early 
months when a fully effective vaccine would not be available, we're taking a 
number of immediate steps. Researchers here at the NIH have developed a vaccine 
based on the current strain of the avian flu virus; the vaccine is already in 
clinical trials. And I am asking that the Congress fund $1.2 billion for the 
Department of Health and Human Services to purchase enough doses of this vaccine 
from manufacturers to vaccinate 20 million people.This vaccine would not be a perfect match to 
pandemic flu because the pandemic strain would probably differ somewhat from the 
avian flu virus it grew from. But a vaccine against the current avian flu virus 
would likely offer some protection against a pandemic strain, and possibly save 
many lives in the first critical months of an outbreak.We're also increasing stockpiles of antiviral 
drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza. Antiviral drugs cannot prevent people from 
contracting the flu. It can -- but they can reduce the severity of the illness 
when taken within 48 hours of getting sick. So in addition to vaccines, which 
are the foundation of our pandemic response, I am asking Congress for a billion 
dollars to stockpile additional antiviral medications, so that we have enough on 
hand to help treat first responders and those on the front lines, as well as 
populations most at risk in the first stages of a pandemic.To protect the greatest possible number of 
Americans during a pandemic, the cornerstone of our strategy is to develop new 
technologies that will allow us to produce new vaccines rapidly. If a pandemic 
strikes our country -- if a pandemic strikes, our country must have a surge 
capacity in place that will allow us to bring a new vaccine online quickly and 
manufacture enough to immunize every American against the pandemic strain.I recently met with leaders of the vaccine 
industry. They assured me that they will work with the federal government to 
expand the vaccine industry, so that our country is better prepared for any 
pandemic. Today, the NIH is working with vaccine makers to develop new 
cell-culture techniques that will help us bring a pandemic flu vaccine to the 
American people faster in the event of an outbreak. Right now, most vaccines are 
still produced with 1950's technology using chicken eggs that are infected with 
the influenza virus and then used to develop and produce vaccines. In the event 
of a pandemic, this antiquated process would take many, many months to produce a 
vaccine, and it would not allow us to produce enough vaccine for every American 
in time.Since American lives depend on rapid advances in 
vaccine production technology, we must fund a crash program to help our best 
scientists bring the next generation of technology online rapidly. I'm asking 
Congress for $2.8 billion to accelerate development of cell-culture technology. 
By bringing cell-culture technology from the research laboratory into the 
production line, we should be able to produce enough vaccine for every American 
within six months of the start of a pandemic.I'm also asking Congress to remove one of the 
greatest obstacles to domestic vaccine production: the growing burden of 
litigation. In the past three decades, the number of vaccine manufacturers in 
America has plummeted, as the industry has been flooded with lawsuits. Today, 
there is only one manufacturer in the United States that can produce influenza 
vaccine. That leaves our nation vulnerable in the event of a pandemic. We must 
increase the number of vaccine manufacturers in our country, and improve our 
domestic production capacity. So Congress must pass liability protection for the 
makers of life-saving vaccines.By making wise investments in technology and 
breaking down barriers to vaccine production, we're working toward a clear goal: 
In the event of a pandemic, we must have enough vaccine for every American.The third part of our strategy is to ensure that 
we are ready to respond to a pandemic outbreak. A pandemic is unlike other 
natural disasters; outbreaks can happen simultaneously in hundreds, or even 
thousands, of locations at the same time. And unlike storms or floods, which 
strike in an instant and then recede, a pandemic can continue spreading 
destruction in repeated waves that can last for a year or more.To respond to a pandemic, we must have emergency 
plans in place in all 50 states and every local community. We must ensure that 
all levels of government are ready to act to contain an outbreak. We must be 
able to deliver vaccines and other treatments to frontline responders and 
at-risk populations.So my administration is working with public health 
officials in the medical community to develop -- to develop effective pandemic 
emergency plans. We're working at the federal level. We're looking at ways and 
options to coordinate our response with state and local leaders. I've asked Mike 
Leavitt -- Secretary Leavitt -- to bring together state and local public health 
officials from across the nation to discuss their plans for a pandemic, and to 
help them improve pandemic planning at the community level. I'm asking Congress 
to provide $583 million for pandemic preparedness, including $100 million to 
help states complete and exercise their pandemic plans now, before a pandemic 
strikes.If an influenza pandemic strikes, every nation, 
every state in this Union, and every community in these states, must be ready.To respond to a pandemic, we need medical 
personnel and adequate supplies of equipment. In a pandemic, everything from 
syringes to hospital beds, respirators, masks and protective equipment would be 
in short supply. So the federal government is stockpiling critical supplies in 
locations across America as part of the Strategic National Stockpile. The 
Department of Health and Human Services is helping states create rosters of 
medical personnel who are willing to help alleviate local shortfalls during a 
pandemic. And every federal department involved in health care is expanding 
plans to ensure that all federal medical facilities, personnel, and response 
capabilities are available to support local communities in the event of a 
pandemic crisis.To respond to a pandemic, the American people need 
to have information to protect themselves and others. In a pandemic, an 
infection carried by one person can be transmitted to many other people, and so 
every American must take personal responsibility for stopping the spread of the 
virus. To provide Americans with more information about pandemics, we're 
launching a new website, pandemicflu.gov. That ought to be easy for people to 
remember: pandemicflu.gov. The website will keep our citizens informed about the 
preparations underway, steps they can take now to prepare for a pandemic, and 
what every American can do to decrease their risk of contracting and spreading 
the disease in the event of an outbreak.To respond to a pandemic, members of the 
international community will continue to work together. An influenza pandemic 
would be an event with global consequences, and therefore we're continuing to 
meet to develop a global response. We've called nations together in the past, 
and will continue to call nations together to work with public health experts to 
better coordinate our efforts to deal with a disaster.Now, all the steps I've outlined today require 
immediate resources. Because a pandemic could strike at any time, we can't waste 
time in preparing. So to meet all our goals, I'm requesting a total of $7.1 
billion in emergency funding from the United States Congress. By making critical 
investments today, we'll strengthen our ability to safeguard the American people 
in the awful event of a devastating global pandemic, and at the same time will 
bring our nation's public health and medical infrastructure more squarely in the 
21st century.The steps I have outlined will also help our 
nation in other critical ways. By perfecting cell-based technologies now, we 
will be able to produce vaccines for a range of illnesses and save countless 
lives. By strengthening our domestic vaccine industry, we can help ensure that 
our nation will never again have a shortage of vaccine for seasonal -- seasonal 
flu. And by putting in place and exercising pandemic emergency plans across the 
nation, we can help our nation prepare for other dangers -- such as a terrorist 
attack using chemical or biological weapons.Leaders at every level of government have a 
responsibility to confront dangers before they appear, and engage the American 
people on the best course of action. It is vital that our nation discuss and 
address the threat of pandemic flu now. There is no pandemic flu in our country 
or in the world at this time -- but if we wait for a pandemic to appear, it will 
be too late to prepare, and one day many lives could be needlessly lost because 
we failed to act today.By preparing now, we can give our citizens some 
peace of mind knowing that our nation is ready to act at the first sign of 
danger, and that we have the plans in place to prevent and, if necessary, 
withstand an influenza pandemic.Thank you for coming today to let me outline my 
strategy. Thank the United States Congress for considering this measure.May God bless you all.",national strategy avian flu pandemic address flu pandemic strategydelivered november bethesda marylandthank

62,08 November 2006,>George W. Bush - Iraq Strategy Speech at the US Naval Acade,"Thanks for the 
		warm welcome. It's good to be back at the Naval Academy. I'm pleased to 
		provide a convenient excuse for you to miss class.This is the first year that every class of midshipmen at this Academy 
		arrived after the attacks of September the 11th, 2001. Each of you has 
		volunteered to wear our nation's uniform in a time of war -- knowing all 
		the risks and dangers that accompany military service. Our citizens are 
		grateful for your devotion to duty -- and America is proud of the men 
		and women of the United States Naval Academy.I thank Admiral Rempt for his invitation 
		for me to come and give this speech. I appreciate Admiral Mike Mullen. 
		I'm traveling today with a man who's done a fine job as the Secretary of 
		Defense -- Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Navy aviator, Don 
		Rumsfeld. I'm proud that the Governor of the great state of Maryland, 
		Bob Ehrlich, and his wife, Kendel, is with us. Thanks for being here, 
		Governor.I so appreciate that members of the United States Congress have joined 
		us, starting with the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
		Senator John Warner of the state of Virginia. Former Secretary of the 
		United States Navy, I might add. Chairman of the House Permanent Select 
		Committee on Intelligence, Congressman Pete Hoekstra. From the state of 
		Arizona, Congressman John Shadegg. And from the state of Indiana, 
		Congressman Mike Pence. I'm honored you all came, thanks for being here.I appreciate the Mayor of the city of Annapolis, Mayor Ellen Moyer, 
		joining us. I want to thank all the state and local officials. I want to 
		thank the faculty members here. Thank you all for letting me come by.Six months ago, I came here to address the graduating class of 2005. I 
		spoke to them about the importance of their service in the first war of 
		the 21st century -- the global war on terror. I told the class of 2005 
		that four years at this Academy had prepared them morally, mentally and 
		physically for the challenges ahead. And now they're meeting those 
		challenges as officers in the United States Navy and Marine Corps.Some of your former classmates are training with Navy SEAL teams that 
		will storm terrorist safe houses in lightning raids. Others are 
		preparing to lead Marine rifle platoons that will hunt the enemy in the 
		mountains of Afghanistan and the streets of Iraqi cities. Others are 
		training as naval aviators who will fly combat missions over the skies 
		of Afghanistan and Iraq and elsewhere. Still others are training as 
		sailors and submariners who will deliver the combat power of the United 
		States to the farthest regions of the world -- and deliver compassionate 
		assistance to those suffering from natural disasters. Whatever their 
		chosen mission, every graduate of the class of 2005 is bringing honor to 
		the uniform -- and helping to bring us victory in the war on terror.In the years ahead, you'll join them in the fight. Your service is 
		needed, because our nation is engaged in a war that is being fought on 
		many fronts -- from the streets of Western cities, to the mountains of 
		Afghanistan, the islands of Southeast Asia and the Horn of Africa. This 
		war is going to take many turns, and the enemy must be defeated on every 
		battlefield. Yet the terrorists have made it clear that Iraq is the 
		central front in their war against humanity, and so we must recognize 
		Iraq as the central front in the war on terror.As we fight the enemy in Iraq, every man and woman who volunteers to 
		defend our nation deserves an unwavering commitment to the mission -- 
		and a clear strategy for victory. A clear strategy begins with a clear 
		understanding of the enemy we face. The enemy in Iraq is a combination 
		of rejectionists, Saddamists and terrorists. The rejectionists are by 
		far the largest group. These are ordinary Iraqis, mostly Sunni Arabs, 
		who miss the privileged status they had under the regime of Saddam 
		Hussein -- and they reject an Iraq in which they are no longer the 
		dominant group.Not all Sunnis fall into the rejectionist camp. Of those that do, most 
		are not actively fighting us -- but some give aid and comfort to the 
		enemy. Many Sunnis boycotted the January elections -- yet as democracy 
		takes hold in Iraq, they are recognizing that opting out of the 
		democratic process has hurt their interests. And today, those who 
		advocate violent opposition are being increasingly isolated by Sunnis 
		who choose peaceful participation in the democratic process. Sunnis 
		voted in the recent constitutional referendum in large numbers -- and 
		Sunni coalitions have formed to compete in next month's elections -- or, 
		this month's elections. We believe that, over time, most rejectionists 
		will be persuaded to support a democratic Iraq led by a federal 
		government that is a strong enough government to protect minority 
		rights.The second group that makes up the enemy in Iraq is smaller, but more 
		determined. It contains former regime loyalists who held positions of 
		power under Saddam Hussein -- people who still harbor dreams of 
		returning to power. These hard-core Saddamists are trying to foment 
		anti-democratic sentiment amongst the larger Sunni community. They lack 
		popular support and therefore cannot stop Iraq's democratic progress. 
		And over time, they can be marginalized and defeated by the Iraqi people 
		and the security forces of a free Iraq.The third group is the smallest, but the most lethal: the terrorists 
		affiliated with or inspired by al Qaeda . Many are foreigners who are 
		coming to fight freedom's progress in Iraq. This group includes 
		terrorists from Saudi Arabia, and Syria, and Iran, and Egypt, and Sudan, 
		and Yemen, and Libya, and other countries. Our commanders believe 
		they're responsible for most of the suicide bombings, and the 
		beheadings, and the other atrocities we see on our television.They're led by a brutal terrorist named Zarqawi -- al Qaeda's chief of 
		operations in Iraq -- who has pledged his allegiance to Osama bin Laden. 
		Their objective is to drive the United States and coalition forces out 
		of Iraq, and use the vacuum that would be created by an American retreat 
		to gain control of that country. They would then use Iraq as a base from 
		which to launch attacks against America, and overthrow moderate 
		governments in the Middle East, and try to establish a totalitarian 
		Islamic empire that reaches from Indonesia to Spain. That's their stated 
		objective. That's what their leadership has said.These terrorists have nothing to offer the Iraqi people. All they have 
		is the capacity and the willingness to kill the innocent and create 
		chaos for the cameras. They are trying to shake our will to achieve 
		their stated objectives. They will fail. America's will is strong. And 
		they will fail because the will to power is no match for the universal 
		desire to live in liberty.The terrorists in Iraq share the same ideology as the terrorists who 
		struck the United States on September the 11th. Those terrorists share 
		the same ideology with those who blew up commuters in London and Madrid, 
		murdered tourists in Bali, workers in Riyadh, and guests at a wedding in 
		Amman, Jordan. Just last week, they massacred Iraqi children and their 
		parents at a toy give-away outside an Iraqi hospital.This is an enemy without conscience -- and they cannot be appeased. If 
		we were not fighting and destroying this enemy in Iraq, they would not 
		be idle. They would be plotting and killing Americans across the world 
		and within our own borders. By fighting these terrorists in Iraq, 
		Americans in uniform are defeating a direct threat to the American 
		people. Against this adversary, there is only one effective response: We 
		will never back down. We will never give in. And we will never accept 
		anything less than complete victory.To achieve victory over such enemies, we are pursuing a comprehensive 
		strategy in Iraq. Americans should have a clear understanding of this 
		strategy -- how we look at the war, how we see the enemy, how we define 
		victory, and what we're doing to achieve it. So today, we're releasing a 
		document called the ""National Strategy for Victory in Iraq."" This is an 
		unclassified version of the strategy we've been pursuing in Iraq, and it 
		is posted on the White House website -- whitehouse.gov. I urge all 
		Americans to read it.Our strategy in Iraq has three elements. On the political side, we know 
		that free societies are peaceful societies, so we're helping the Iraqis 
		build a free society with inclusive democratic institutions that will 
		protect the interests of all Iraqis. We're working with the Iraqis to 
		help them engage those who can be persuaded to join the new Iraq -- and 
		to marginalize those who never will. On the security side, coalition and 
		Iraqi security forces are on the offensive against the enemy, cleaning 
		out areas controlled by the terrorists and Saddam loyalists, leaving 
		Iraqi forces to hold territory taken from the enemy, and following up 
		with targeted reconstruction to help Iraqis rebuild their lives.As we fight the terrorists, we're working to build capable and effective 
		Iraqi security forces, so they can take the lead in the fight -- and 
		eventually take responsibility for the safety and security of their 
		citizens without major foreign assistance.And on the economic side, we're helping the Iraqis rebuild their 
		infrastructure, reform their economy, and build the prosperity that will 
		give all Iraqis a stake in a free and peaceful Iraq. In doing all this 
		we have involved the United Nations, other international organizations, 
		our coalition partners, and supportive regional states in helping Iraqis 
		build their future.In the days ahead, I'll be discussing the various pillars of our 
		strategy in Iraq. Today, I want to speak in depth about one aspect of 
		this strategy that will be critical to victory in Iraq -- and that's the 
		training of Iraqi security forces. To defeat the terrorists and 
		marginalize the Saddamists and rejectionists, Iraqis need strong 
		military and police forces. Iraqi troops bring knowledge and 
		capabilities to the fight that coalition forces cannot.Iraqis know their people, they know their language, and they know their 
		culture -- and they know who the terrorists are. Iraqi forces are 
		earning the trust of their countrymen -- who are willing to help them in 
		the fight against the enemy. As the Iraqi forces grow in number, they're 
		helping to keep a better hold on the cities taken from the enemy. And as 
		the Iraqi forces grow more capable, they are increasingly taking the 
		lead in the fight against the terrorists. Our goal is to train enough 
		Iraqi forces so they can carry the fight -- and this will take time and 
		patience. And it's worth the time, and it's worth the effort -- because 
		Iraqis and Americans share a common enemy, and when that enemy is 
		defeated in Iraq, Americans will be safer here at home.The training of the Iraqi security forces is an enormous task, and it 
		always hasn't gone smoothly. We all remember the reports of some Iraqi 
		security forces running from the fight more than a year ago. Yet in the 
		past year, Iraqi forces have made real progress. At this time last year, 
		there were only a handful of Iraqi battalions ready for combat. Now, 
		there are over 120 Iraqi Army and Police combat battalions in the fight 
		against the terrorists -- typically comprised of between 350 and 800 
		Iraqi forces. Of these, about 80 Iraqi battalions are fighting 
		side-by-side with coalition forces, and about 40 others are taking the 
		lead in the fight. Most of these 40 battalions are controlling their own 
		battle space, and conducting their own operations against the terrorists 
		with some coalition support -- and they're helping to turn the tide of 
		this struggle in freedom's favor. America and our troops are proud to 
		stand with the brave Iraqi fighters.The progress of the Iraqi forces is especially clear when the recent 
		anti-terrorist operations in Tal Afar are compared with last year's 
		assault in Fallujah. In Fallujah, the assault was led by nine coalition 
		battalions made up primarily of United States Marines and Army -- with 
		six Iraqi battalions supporting them. The Iraqis fought and sustained 
		casualties. Yet in most situations, the Iraqi role was limited to 
		protecting the flanks of coalition forces, and securing ground that had 
		already been cleared by our troops. This year in TAL Afar, it was a very 
		different story.The assault was primarily led by Iraqi security forces -- 11 Iraqi 
		battalions, backed by five coalition battalions providing support. Many 
		Iraqi units conducted their own anti-terrorist operations and controlled 
		their own battle space -- hunting for enemy fighters and securing 
		neighborhoods block-by-block. To consolidate their military success, 
		Iraqi units stayed behind to help maintain law and order -- and 
		reconstruction projects have been started to improve infrastructure and 
		create jobs and provide hope.One of the Iraqi soldiers who fought in TAL Afar was a private named 
		Tarek Hazem. This brave Iraqi fighter says, ""We're not afraid. We're 
		here to protect our country. All we feel is motivated to kill the 
		terrorists."" Iraqi forces not only cleared the city, they held it. And 
		because of the skill and courage of the Iraqi forces, the citizens of 
		TAL Afar were able to vote in October's constitutional referendum.As Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead in the fight against the 
		terrorists, they're also taking control of more and more Iraqi 
		territory. At this moment, over 30 Iraqi Army battalions have assumed 
		primary control of their own areas of responsibility. In Baghdad, Iraqi 
		battalions have taken over major sectors of the capital -- including 
		some of the city's toughest neighborhoods. Last year, the area around 
		Baghdad's Haifa Street was so thick with terrorists that it earned the 
		nickname ""Purple Heart Boulevard."" Then Iraqi forces took responsibility 
		for this dangerous neighborhood -- and attacks are now down.Our coalition has handed over roughly 90 square miles of Baghdad 
		province to Iraqi security forces. Iraqi battalions have taken over 
		responsibility for areas in South-Central Iraq, sectors of Southeast 
		Iraq, sectors of Western Iraq, and sectors of North-Central Iraq. As 
		Iraqi forces take responsibility for more of their own territory, 
		coalition forces can concentrate on training Iraqis and hunting down 
		high-value targets, like the terrorist Zarqawi and his associates.We're also transferring forward operating bases to Iraqi control. Over a 
		dozen bases in Iraq have been handed over to the Iraqi government -- 
		including Saddam Hussein's former palace in Tikrit, which has served as 
		the coalition headquarters in one of Iraq's most dangerous regions. From 
		many of these bases, the Iraqi security forces are planning and 
		executing operations against the terrorists -- and bringing security and 
		pride to the Iraqi people.Progress by the Iraqi security forces has come, in part, because we 
		learned from our earlier experiences and made changes in the way we help 
		train Iraqi troops. When our coalition first arrived, we began the 
		process of creating an Iraqi Army to defend the country from external 
		threats, and an Iraqi Civil Defense Corps to help provide the security 
		within Iraq's borders. The civil defense forces did not have sufficient 
		firepower or training -- they proved to be no match for an enemy armed 
		with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, and mortars. So the 
		approach was adjusted. Working with Iraq's leaders, we moved the civil 
		defense forces into the Iraqi Army, we changed the way they're trained 
		and equipped, and we focused the Army's mission on defeating those 
		fighting against a free Iraq, whether internal or external.Now, all Iraqi Army recruits receive about the same length of basic 
		training as new recruits in the U.S. Army -- a five-week core course, 
		followed by an additional three-to-seven weeks of specialized training. 
		With coalition help, Iraqis have established schools for the Iraqi 
		military services, an Iraqi military academy, a non-commissioned officer 
		academy, a military police school, a bomb disposal school -- and NATO 
		has established an Iraqi Joint Staff College. There's also an increased 
		focus on leadership training, with professional development courses for 
		Iraqi squad leaders and platoon sergeants and warrant officers and 
		sergeants-major. A new generation of Iraqi officers is being trained, 
		leaders who will lead their forces with skill -- so they can defeat the 
		terrorists and secure their freedom.Similar changes have taken place in the training of the Iraqi police. 
		When our coalition first arrived, Iraqi police recruits spent too much 
		time of their training in classroom lectures -- and they received 
		limited training in the use of small arms. This did not adequately 
		prepare the fight they would face. And so we changed the way the Iraqi 
		police are trained. Now, police recruits spend more of their time 
		outside the classroom with intensive hands-on training in anti-terrorism 
		operations and real-world survival skills.Iraq has now six basic police academies, and one in Jordan, that 
		together produce over 3,500 new police officers every ten weeks. The 
		Baghdad police academy has simulation models where Iraqis train to stop 
		IED attacks and operate roadblocks. And because Iraqi police are not 
		just facing common criminals, they are getting live-fire training with 
		the AK-47s.As more and more skilled Iraqi security forces have come online, there's 
		been another important change in the way new Iraqi recruits are trained. 
		When the training effort began, nearly all the trainers came from 
		coalition countries. Today, the vast majority of Iraqi police and army 
		recruits are being taught by Iraqi instructors. By training the 
		trainers, we're helping Iraqis create an institutional capability that 
		will allow the Iraqi forces to continue to develop and grow long after 
		coalition forces have left Iraq.As the training has improved, so has the quality of the recruits being 
		trained. Even though the terrorists are targeting Iraqi police and army 
		recruits, there is no shortage of Iraqis who are willing to risk their 
		lives to secure the future of a free Iraq.The efforts to include more Sunnis in the future of Iraq were given a 
		significant boost earlier this year. More than 60 influential Sunni 
		clerics issued a fatwa calling on young Sunnis to join the Iraqi 
		security forces, ""for the sake of preserving the souls, property and 
		honor"" of the Iraqi people. These religious leaders are helping to make 
		the Iraqi security forces a truly national institution -- one that is 
		able to serve, protect and defend all the Iraqi people.Some critics dismiss this progress and point to the fact that only one 
		Iraqi battalion has achieved complete independence from the coalition. 
		To achieve complete independence, an Iraqi battalion must do more than 
		fight the enemy on its own -- it must also have the ability to provide 
		its own support elements, including logistics, airlift, intelligence, 
		and command and control through their ministries. Not every Iraqi unit 
		has to meet this level of capability in order for the Iraqi security 
		forces to take the lead in the fight against the enemy. As a matter of 
		fact, there are some battalions from NATO militaries that would not be 
		able to meet this standard. The facts are that Iraqi units are growing 
		more independent and more capable; they are defending their new 
		democracy with courage and determination. They're in the fight today, 
		and they will be in the fight for freedom tomorrow.We're also helping Iraqis build the institutions they need to support 
		their own forces. For example, a national depot has been established 
		north of Baghdad that is responsible for supplying the logistical needs 
		of the ten divisions of the Iraqi Army. Regional support units and base 
		support units have been created across the country with the mission of 
		supplying their own war fighters. Iraqis now have a small Air Force, 
		that recently conducted its first combat airlift operations -- bringing 
		Iraqi troops to the front in TAL Afar. The new Iraqi Navy is now helping 
		protect the vital ports of Basra and Umm Qasr. An Iraqi military 
		intelligence school has been established to produce skilled Iraqi 
		intelligence analysts and collectors. By taking all these steps, we're 
		helping the Iraqi security forces become self-supporting so they can 
		take the fight to the enemy, and so they can sustain themselves in the 
		fight.Over the past two and a half years, we've faced some setbacks in 
		standing up a capable Iraqi security force -- and their performance is 
		still uneven in some areas. Yet many of those forces have made real 
		gains over the past year -- and Iraqi soldiers take pride in their 
		progress. An Iraqi first lieutenant named Shoqutt describes the 
		transformation of his unit this way: ""I really think we've turned the 
		corner here. At first, the whole country didn't take us seriously. Now 
		things are different. Our guys are hungry to demonstrate their skill and 
		to show the world.""Our troops in Iraq see the gains that Iraqis are making. Lieutenant 
		Colonel Todd Wood of Richmond Hill, Georgia, is training Iraqi forces in 
		Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit. He says this about the Iraqi units 
		he is working with: ""They're pretty much ready to go it on their own ... 
		What they're doing now would have been impossible a year ago ... These 
		guys are patriots, willing to go out knowing the insurgents would like 
		nothing better than to kill them and their families ... They're getting 
		better, and they'll keep getting better.""Our commanders on the ground see the gains the Iraqis are making. 
		General Marty Dempsey is the commander of the Multinational Security 
		Transition Command. Here's what he says about the transformation of the 
		Iraqi security forces: ""It's beyond description. They are far better 
		equipped, far better trained"" than they once were. The Iraqis, General 
		Dempsey says, are ""increasingly in control of their future and their own 
		security _ the Iraqi security forces are regaining control of the 
		country.""As the Iraqi security forces stand up, their confidence is growing and 
		they are taking on tougher and more important missions on their own. As 
		the Iraqi security forces stand up, the confidence of the Iraqi people 
		is growing -- and Iraqis are providing the vital intelligence needed to 
		track down the terrorists. And as the Iraqi security forces stand up, 
		coalition forces can stand down -- and when our mission of defeating the 
		terrorists in Iraq is complete, our troops will return home to a proud 
		nation.This is a goal our Iraqi allies share. An Iraqi Army Sergeant named 
		Abbass Abdul Jabar puts it this way: ""We have to help the coalition 
		forces as much as we can to give them a chance to go home. These guys 
		have been helping us. [Now] we have to protect our own families."" 
		America will help the Iraqis so they can protect their families and 
		secure their free nation. We will stay as long as necessary to complete 
		the mission. If our military leaders tell me we need more troops, I will 
		send them.For example, we have increased our force levels in Iraq to 160,000 -- up 
		from 137,000 -- in preparation for the December elections. My commanders 
		tell me that as Iraqi forces become more capable, the mission of our 
		forces in Iraq will continue to change. We will continue to shift from 
		providing security and conducting operations against the enemy 
		nationwide, to conducting more specialized operations targeted at the 
		most dangerous terrorists. We will increasingly move out of Iraqi 
		cities, reduce the number of bases from which we operate, and conduct 
		fewer patrols and convoys.As the Iraqi forces gain experience and the political process advances, 
		we will be able to decrease our troop levels in Iraq without losing our 
		capability to defeat the terrorists. These decisions about troop levels 
		will be driven by the conditions on the ground in Iraq and the good 
		judgment of our commanders -- not by artificial timetables set by 
		politicians in Washington.Some are calling for a deadline for withdrawal. Many advocating an 
		artificial timetable for withdrawing our troops are sincere -- but I 
		believe they're sincerely wrong. Pulling our troops out before they've 
		achieved their purpose is not a plan for victory. As Democratic Senator 
		Joe Lieberman said recently, setting an artificial timetable would 
		""discourage our troops because it seems to be heading for the door. It 
		will encourage the terrorists, it will confuse the Iraqi people.""Senator Lieberman is right. Setting an artificial deadline to withdraw 
		would send a message across the world that America is a weak and an 
		unreliable ally. Setting an artificial deadline to withdraw would send a 
		signal to our enemies -- that if they wait long enough, America will cut 
		and run and abandon its friends. And setting an artificial deadline to 
		withdraw would vindicate the terrorists' tactics of beheadings and 
		suicide bombings and mass murder -- and invite new attacks on America. 
		To all who wear the uniform, I make you this pledge: America will not 
		run in the face of car bombers and assassins so long as I am your 
		Commander-in-Chief.And as we train Iraqis to take more responsibility in the battle with 
		the terrorists, we're also helping them build a democracy that is worthy 
		of their sacrifice. And in just over two-and-a-half years, the Iraqi 
		people have made incredible progress on the road to lasting freedom. 
		Iraqis have gone from living under the boot of a brutal tyrant, to 
		liberation, free elections, and a democratic constitution -- and in 15 
		days they will go to the polls to elect a fully constitutional 
		government that will lead them for the next four years.With each ballot cast, the Iraqi people have sent a clear message to the 
		terrorists: Iraqis will not be intimidated. The Iraqi people will 
		determine the destiny of their country. The future of Iraq belongs to 
		freedom. Despite the costs, the pain, and the danger, Iraqis are showing 
		courage and are moving forward to build a free society and a lasting 
		democracy in the heart of the Middle East -- and the United States of 
		America will help them succeed.Some critics continue to assert that we have no plan in Iraq except to, 
		""stay the course."" If by ""stay the course,"" they mean we will not allow 
		the terrorists to break our will, they are right. If by ""stay the 
		course,"" they mean we will not permit al Qaeda to turn Iraq into what 
		Afghanistan was under the Taliban -- a safe haven for terrorism and a 
		launching pad for attacks on America -- they are right, as well. If by 
		""stay the course"" they mean that we're not learning from our 
		experiences, or adjusting our tactics to meet the challenges on the 
		ground, then they're flat wrong. As our top commander in Iraq, General 
		Casey, has said, ""Our commanders on the ground are continuously adapting 
		and adjusting, not only to what the enemy does, but also to try to 
		out-think the enemy and get ahead of him."" Our strategy in Iraq is 
		clear, our tactics are flexible and dynamic; we have changed them as 
		conditions required and they are bringing us victory against a brutal 
		enemy.Victory in Iraq will demand the continued determination and resolve of 
		the American people. It will also demand the strength and personal 
		courage of the men and women who wear our nation's uniform. And as the 
		future officers of the United States Navy and Marine Corps, you're 
		preparing to join this fight. You do so at a time when there is a 
		vigorous debate about the war in Iraq. I know that for our men and women 
		in uniform, this debate can be unsettling -- when you're risking your 
		life to accomplish a mission, the last thing you want to hear is that 
		mission being questioned in our nation's capital. I want you to know 
		that while there may be a lot of heated rhetoric in Washington, D.C., 
		one thing is not in dispute: The American people stand behind you.And we should not fear the debate in Washington. It's one of the great 
		strengths of our democracy that we can discuss our differences openly 
		and honestly -- even at times of war. Your service makes that freedom 
		possible. And today, because of the men and women in our military, 
		people are expressing their opinions freely in the streets of Baghdad, 
		as well.Most Americans want two things in Iraq: They want to see our troops win, 
		and they want to see our troops come home as soon as possible. And those 
		are my goals as well. I will settle for nothing less than complete 
		victory. In World War II, victory came when the Empire of Japan 
		surrendered on the deck of the USS Missouri. In Iraq, there will not be 
		a signing ceremony on the deck of a battleship. Victory will come when 
		the terrorists and Saddamists can no longer threaten Iraq's democracy, 
		when the Iraqi security forces can provide for the safety of their own 
		citizens, and when Iraq is not a safe haven for terrorists to plot new 
		attacks on our nation.As we make progress toward victory, Iraqis will take more responsibility 
		for their security, and fewer U.S. forces will be needed to complete the 
		mission. America will not abandon Iraq. We will not turn that country 
		over to the terrorists and put the American people at risk. Iraq will be 
		a free nation and a strong ally in the Middle East -- and this will add 
		to the security of the American people.In the short run, we're going to bring justice to our enemies. In the 
		long run, the best way to ensure the security of our own citizens is to 
		spread the hope of freedom across the broader Middle East. We've seen 
		freedom conquer evil and secure the peace before. In World War II, free 
		nations came together to fight the ideology of fascism, and freedom 
		prevailed -- and today Germany and Japan are democracies and they are 
		allies in securing the peace. In the Cold War, freedom defeated the 
		ideology of communism and led to a democratic movement that freed the 
		nations of Eastern and Central Europe from Soviet domination -- and 
		today these nations are allies in the war on terror.Today in the Middle East freedom is once again contending with an 
		ideology that seeks to sow anger and hatred and despair. And like 
		fascism and communism before, the hateful ideologies that use terror 
		will be defeated by the unstoppable power of freedom, and as democracy 
		spreads in the Middle East, these countries will become allies in the 
		cause of peace.Advancing the cause of freedom and democracy in the Middle East begins 
		with ensuring the success of a free Iraq. Freedom's victory in that 
		country will inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran, and 
		spread hope across a troubled region, and lift a terrible threat from 
		the lives of our citizens. By strengthening Iraqi democracy, we will 
		gain a partner in the cause of peace and moderation in the Muslim world, 
		and an ally in the worldwide struggle against -- against the terrorists. 
		Advancing the ideal of democracy and self-government is the mission that 
		created our nation -- and now it is the calling of a new generation of 
		Americans. We will meet the challenge of our time. We will answer 
		history's call with confidence -- because we know that freedom is the 
		destiny of every man, woman and child on this earth.Before our mission in Iraq is accomplished, there will be tough days 
		ahead. A time of war is a time of sacrifice, and we've lost some very 
		fine men and women in this war on terror. Many of you know comrades and 
		classmates who left our shores to defend freedom and who did not live to 
		make the journey home. We pray for the military families who mourn the 
		loss of loves ones. We hold them in our hearts -- and we honor the 
		memory of every fallen soldier, sailor, airman, Coast Guardsman, and 
		Marine.One of those fallen heroes is a Marine Corporal named Jeff Starr, who 
		was killed fighting the terrorists in Ramadi earlier this year. After he 
		died, a letter was found on his laptop computer. Here's what he wrote, 
		he said, ""[I]f you're reading this, then I've died in Iraq. I don't 
		regret going. Everybody dies, but few get to do it for something as 
		important as freedom. It may seem confusing why we are in Iraq, it's not 
		to me. I'm here helping these people, so they can live the way we live. 
		Not [to] have to worry about tyrants or vicious dictators_. Others have 
		died for my freedom, now this is my mark.""There is only one way to honor the sacrifice of Corporal Starr and his 
		fallen comrades -- and that is to take up their mantle, carry on their 
		fight, and complete their mission.We will take the fight to the terrorists. We will help the Iraqi people 
		lay the foundations of a strong democracy that can govern itself, 
		sustain itself, and defend itself. And by laying the foundations of 
		freedom in Iraq, we will lay the foundation of peace for generations to 
		come.You all are the ones who will help accomplish all this. Our freedom and 
		our way of life are in your hands -- and they're in the best of hands. I 
		want to thank you for your service in the cause of freedom. I want to 
		thank you for wearing the uniform.May God bless you all, and may God 
		continue to bless the United States of America.",thank warm welcome good back naval academy please provide convenient excuse miss first year every class midshipman academy arrive attack september

63,16 April 2007,>American Rhetoric: George W. Bush: March for Life Address via Telepho,"Nellie, thank you very much. I appreciate the invitation to speak. I'm 
calling from Manhattan, Kansas. Sounds like you got some good folks from Kansas 
there. I want to thank everybody there -- if you're from Kansas, or anywhere 
else in our country, for your devotion to such a noble cause.You believe, as I do, that every human life has value, that the strong have a 
duty to protect the weak, and that the self-evident truths of the Declaration of 
Independence apply to everyone, not just to those considered healthy or wanted 
or convenient. These principles call us to defend the sick and the dying, 
persons with disabilities and birth defects, all who are weak and vulnerable, 
especially unborn children.We're making good progress in defending these principles, Nellie, and you and 
I are working together, along with others, to build what I've called a ""culture 
of life."" One of my first acts as the President was to ban the use of taxpayer 
money on programs that promote abortion overseas. I want to thank you all for 
getting that ban on partial-birth abortion to my desk, a bill I was proud to 
sign -- and a law which we are going to defend -- and are defending -- 
vigorously in our courts. Because we acted, infants who are born despite an 
attempted abortion are now protected by law. Thanks to ""Laci and Conner's Law,"" 
prosecutors can now charge those who harm or kill a pregnant woman with harming 
or killing her unborn child, as well.We're vigorously promoting parental notification laws, adoption, teen 
abstinence, crisis pregnancy programs, and the vital work of our faith-based 
groups. We're sending a clear message to any woman facing a crisis pregnancy: We 
love you; we love your child, and we're here to help you.There's more work to be done. The House has passed a bill to ensure that 
state parental involvement laws are not circumvented by those who take minors 
across state lines to have abortion[s]. And the United States Senate needs to 
pass this bill so I can sign it into law.We also must respect human life and dignity when advancing medical science, 
and we're making progress here, as well. Last month, I signed a pro-life bill 
supporting ethical treatment and research using stem cells from umbilical cord 
blood. I also renew my call for Congress to ban all forms of human cloning. 
Because human life is a gift from our Creator and should never be used as a 
means to an end, we will not sanction the creation of life only to destroy it.By changing laws we can change our culture. And your persistence and prayers, 
Nellie, and the folks there with you, are making a real difference. We, of 
course, seek common ground where possible; we're working to persuade more of our 
fellow Americans of the rightness of our cause. And this is a cause that appeals 
to the conscience of our citizens, and is rooted in America's deepest principles 
-- and history tells us that with such a cause, we will prevail.Again, Nellie, thank you for letting me come to speak to you. Tell everybody 
there that I ask for God's blessings on them and their families, and, of course, 
may God continue to bless our grand country.",nellie thank much appreciate invitation speak call manhattan kansa sound like get good folk kansa want thank everybody kansa anywhere else country devotion noble believe every human life value strong duty protect weak truth declaration independence apply everyone consider healthy want convenient principle call u defend sick die person disability birth defect weak vulnerable especially unborn make good progress defend principle nellie work together along others build call culture life one first act president ban use taxpayer money program promote abortion overseas want thank get ban abortion desk bill proud sign law go defend defend vigorously court act infant bear despite attempt abortion protect law thank laci conner law prosecutor charge harm kill pregnant woman harm kill unborn child vigorously promote parental notification law adoption teen abstinence crisis pregnancy program vital work group send clear message woman face crisis pregnancy love love child help work do house pas bill ensure state parental involvement law circumvent take minor across state line abortion unite state senate need pas bill sign also must respect human life dignity advance medical science make progress well last month sign bill support ethical treatment research use stem cell umbilical cord blood also renew call congress ban form human clone human life gift creator never use mean end sanction creation life destroy change law change culture persistence prayer nellie folk make real difference course seek common grind possible work persuade fellow american rightness cause cause appeal conscience citizen root america deepest principle history tell u cause nellie thank let come speak tell everybody ask god bless family course may god continue bless grand country,appreciate invitation speak call manhattan kansa sound get folk kansa thank everybody country devotion life value duty protect truth declaration independence everyone want convenient principle call defend die person disability birth progress principle work others culture life act president ban use money program abortion get abortion desk bill sign law court act abortion protect law thank laci conner law prosecutor charge harm kill woman harm kill child notification law adoption abstinence crisis pregnancy program work group message woman face crisis pregnancy love child help work house bill state involvement law circumvent state line abortion state senate need pas bill sign life dignity advance science make progress month sign bill treatment research use stem cell cord blood congress ban form clone life gift creator end sanction creation life destroy change law change culture persistence prayer folk difference course grind work rightness cause cause appeal conscience citizen root america principle history cause thank everybody ask god family course country

		Thanks for inviting me here to give the Landon Lecture. For those 
		students who are here, I want you to know I can remember what it was 
		like to sit through lectures. I didn't particularly like it then. Some 
		will take a little different approach. I'm here to tell you how I see 
		the world and how I've made some of the decisions I've made and why I 
		made them.Before I get there, I 
		want to thank the introducer. So he's on Air Force One. He says, that's 
		a cute-looking blue tie you have. But I strongly suggest, Mr. President 
		-- I said, I don't know, Senator, if I can take it; I'm worried about 
		all those lobby laws -- or the lack of them. He said, fine, I'll just 
		loan it to you. I said, well, now that you're helping me dress, you got 
		any hints on how I ought to do my hair?Pat Roberts is a good man. 
		He's got a great sense of humor. He loves the people of Kansas and he 
		loves Kansas State and I'm proud to be with him on this stage. And I'm 
		proud to be here, as well, with the other United States Senator, Senator 
		Sam Brownback. Former president of the Kansas State student body.I want to thank the 
		Governor. Governor Sebelius, thanks for putting up with me, Roberts and 
		Brownback as we drove from the airport to here. One hour with the three 
		of us -- it required a lot of patience. I'm proud the Governor came with 
		us, and I want to thank you. I want to thank Congressman Jim Ryun, right 
		from this district. I appreciate you being here, Congressman. I'm not 
		interested in jogging with you.I also thank Congressman 
		Dennis Moore and Congressman Jerry Moran, both fine members of the 
		United Stated Congress from the state of Kansas. Thank you all for 
		coming.I appreciate President 
		Wefald for having me come. I know Laura was his first choice. That's why 
		he's the head of such a fine institution; he's got good judgment. By the 
		way, she sends her best. I married really well.And I want to thank Charles 
		Reagan and Edward Seaton. Charles is the chairman of the Landon Lecture 
		Series. And Edward is the head of the patrons. He said to me, he said, I 
		so appreciate you believing in free speech; thanks for giving a free 
		one.I want to thank Tom Herald, 
		who is the faculty senate president. I want to thank all the faculty 
		members who are here. Thanks for teaching. It's such a noble profession 
		and I appreciate you lending your expertise to help youngsters learn 
		what is possible and how to think, and how to be creative. And I want to 
		thank the president of the student body, Michael Burns, for being here, 
		as well.I appreciate the students 
		being here. I particularly want to thank those who've come from the Last 
		Chance Bar. Better than watching daytime TV I guess. I appreciate your 
		interest in your country; looking forward to sharing some thoughts with 
		you, and then I'll answer some questions.Before I get there, I do 
		want to pay tribute to our wonderful men and women in uniform. Thank you 
		for serving our country.You know, really one of the 
		interesting things about being the President is to invite my guys, 
		buddies I grew up with from Texas, to the White House. It's really neat 
		to see how they react to the majesty of the White House and the Oval 
		Office and the South Lawn, and just the beauty of Washington. And most 
		of them, after they get over the initial shock of seeing the White 
		House, then come to the shock wondering how in the heck I got there.But they, oftentimes, they 
		ask me, they say, what's it like, being the President of the United 
		States? And my answer to them is, first, it's a huge honor. But, 
		secondly, if I had to give you a job description, it would be a 
		decision-maker. I make a lot of decisions. I make some that you see that 
		obviously affect people's lives, not only here, but around the world. I 
		make a lot of small ones you never see, but have got consequence. 
		Decision-maker is the job description.First of all, when you make 
		decisions, you've got to stand on principle. If you're going to make 
		decisions, you've got to know what you believe. I guess the best way to 
		summarize me is I came from Texas and I'm going back to Texas with the 
		exact same values I had when I arrived in Washington, D.C.In order to make good 
		decisions, you've got to rely upon the judgment of people you trust. 
		I'll never forget the first decision I had to make as the President. I 
		wasn't even sworn in yet, and a fellow called me on the phone and he 
		said, what color rug do you want to have in the Oval Office? You've got 
		to be kidding me, man. He said, no, what color rug would you like to 
		have in the Oval Office? I said, I don't know. He said, well, it turns 
		out that Presidents -- you've just got to know Presidents design their 
		rugs. I said, well, to be honest with you, I don't know much about 
		designing rugs.So I called, I delegated -- 
		that's one of the things you do in decision-making. I said, Laura, how 
		about helping design the rug? Part of being a decision-maker, though, is 
		you've got to help -- you've got to think strategically. And so I said 
		to her -- she said, what color do you want? I said, make it say this: 
		optimistic person comes here to work every single day. You can't lead 
		the nation, you can't make good decisions unless you're optimistic about 
		the future.So for the students here, as 
		you take over organizations or head out of college and become involved 
		in your life, you've got to be optimistic about -- if you're going to 
		lead somebody. Imagine somebody saying, follow me, the world is going to 
		be worse. That's not a very good organizing principle about which to 
		lead people. I'm optimistic about our future, and the reason I am is 
		because I believe so strongly in what America stands for: liberty and 
		freedom and human rights, and the human dignity of every single person.Sometimes decisions come to 
		your desk unexpectedly. Part of the job of a President is to be able to 
		plan for the worst and hope for the best; and if the worst comes, be 
		able to react to it. On September the 11th, the worst came. We got 
		attacked. We didn't ask for the attack, but it came. I resolved on that 
		day to do everything I can to protect the American people.You know, a lot of us grew 
		up thinking that oceans would protect us; that if there was a threat 
		overseas, it really didn't concern us because we were safe. That's what 
		history had basically told us -- yes, there was an attack on Pearl 
		Harbor, obviously, but it was a kind of hit-and-run and then we pursued 
		the enemy. A lot of folks -- at least, my age, when I was going to 
		college, I never dreamed that the United States of America could be 
		attacked. And in that we got attacked, I vowed then, like I'm vowing to 
		you today, that I understand my most important priority. My most 
		important job is to protect the security of the American people.I knew right after September 
		the 11th, though, that the attacks would begin to fade in people's 
		memory. I mean, who wants to constantly go through life thinking that 
		you're going to get hit again? Who wants to kind of re-live those days 
		in your memory? As a matter of fact, I asked the American people to go 
		on about your life. But given the fact that it's human nature to forget, 
		or try to put in the past, put the pain in the past, I want to assure 
		you and our fellow Americans I'm not going to put it in the past. The 
		threat to the United States is forefront in my mind. I knew that at 
		times people would say, you know, it may be an isolated incident, let's 
		just don't worry about it. Well, for me it's not an isolated incident. I 
		understand there is still an enemy which lurks out there.And so part of my 
		decision-making process, part of it as you see when I begin to protect 
		you, to do my number one priority, rests upon this fact: that there is 
		an enemy which is relentless and desirous to bring harm to the American 
		people, because of what we believe in. See, we're in an ideological 
		struggle. It's very important for the students here to understand that 
		there is an enemy which has an ideology, and they're driven by an 
		ideology. They make decisions based upon their view of the world, which 
		is the exact opposite of our view of the world.Perhaps the best way to 
		describe their political vision is to remind you what life was like for 
		people living in Afghanistan when the Taliban was running that country 
		with al Qaeda as the parasite. If you were a young girl in that society, 
		you had no chance to get educated. If you spoke out against the view of 
		these folks, their religious view, you could be taken to the public 
		square and whipped. In other words, there was not freedom. There wasn't 
		freedom to worship the way you want to, just like we believe here in the 
		United States of America. You can worship, you can not worship in our 
		country, and you're equally American. You can be a Christian, Jew or 
		Muslim, and you're equally American. It's the greatness of the United 
		States of America which -- which stands in stark contrast to what these 
		ideologues believe.Their vision of the world is 
		dark and dim. They have got desires to spread a totalitarian empire. How 
		do we know? Because they told us. Mr. Zawahiri, the number two in the al 
		Qaeda network, told the world such. He might not have wanted us to read 
		that particular thing he was sending, but nevertheless we did. And he 
		said that, here's our designs and our desires. In other words, these 
		people have got an ideology, and strategy to implement the ideology. 
		They've got a -- they have no heart, no conscience. They kill innocent 
		men, women and children to achieve their objective. These folks cannot 
		be appeased. We can't hope that nice words will change their point of 
		view.And so the decision I made 
		right off the bat is we will find them, and we will hunt them down, and 
		we will bring them to justice before they hurt America again.But that requires a 
		different kind of response than the old days of nations fighting 
		nations. First of all, I want to step back and just tell you -- I 
		probably -- I hope I say this more than once, but committing U.S. troops 
		into harm's way is the last option of the President. It's the hardest 
		decision a President can make. And so when I'm telling you I made the 
		decision, you all have got to understand, I did not take that decision 
		lightly. I knew the consequences, but I also believed that the 
		consequences of not acting against this enemy would mean I wasn't doing 
		my job of working with others to protect the United States of America.So we sent our men and women 
		into harm's way -- all volunteers. It is really important for the United 
		States of America to have an all-volunteer Army. The best way to keep 
		people volunteering in the Army is to make sure they got good pay, good 
		training, good equipment and good housing for their loved ones.But since we're not able to 
		track vast battalions or armadas, we've got to have intelligence, good 
		intelligence, to help us locate the dark corners of the world where 
		these people hide. A lot of the decisions I make, and decisions future 
		Presidents make, will be based upon the capacity of our intelligence 
		services to find the enemy and to understand the intentions of the enemy 
		and to share information with our allies. This is a different kind of 
		struggle and requires the best intelligence possible. That's why we're 
		reevaluating, constantly reevaluating, how best to use our intelligence 
		services to be able to protect the American people.We've got to be strong in 
		diplomacy. Secretary Rice, who is a great diplomat, she followed another 
		great -- she followed another great diplomat in Colin Powell -- they're 
		constantly working to remind people about the stakes. Just like part of 
		my job is to educate the American people about the threats we face, at a 
		lecture series such as this, our government must constantly remind our 
		friends and allies the nature of the enemy and the stakes that all free 
		countries face. There's a diplomatic effort that's constantly going on.You can't run your network 
		without money, and so we're working with our friends and allies to seize 
		terrorist assets and choke off their funding sources. In other words, 
		what I'm telling you is, we're using all assets at our disposal to 
		protect you in a different kind of war. In order to make the right 
		decision about how to win this war, it's important to understand the 
		nature of the enemy and to take the enemy's word seriously and to 
		understand their lethality and not let the kind of lull in the action 
		lull us to sleep.Secondly, right after they 
		attacked us, I laid out a doctrine, and it said, if you harbor a 
		terrorist, you're equally as guilty as the terrorists. The reason I said 
		that is because I understand that a terrorist network can sometimes 
		burrow in society and can sometimes find safe haven from which to plot 
		and plan. The perfect example of that was Afghanistan. For those of you 
		who didn't pay much attention to the initial stages of this war, it 
		became apparent to the world that Afghanistan became a safe haven. 
		You'll hear stories about people that went into Afghanistan to be 
		trained -- trained as to how to brutally kill people, trained in 
		different methodologies, trained in how to communicate.So in other words, the enemy 
		was able to burrow in, and felt safe and confident and secure. And I 
		understood in this different kind of war that we had to make it clear to 
		any country that if they harbored a terrorist, they would be held to 
		account. And when the American President speaks, it's really important 
		for those words to mean something. And so when I said to the Taliban, 
		get rid of al Qaeda, and they didn't, I made the difficult decision to 
		commit our troops, to uphold the doctrine that if you harbor a 
		terrorist, you're equally as guilty as the terrorist. And our kids went 
		in, men and women alike, and liberated a country from the clutches of 
		the barbaric regime, the Taliban.And today, today in 
		Afghanistan, think about what has happened in a brief period of time -- 
		today in Afghanistan there is a fledgling democracy. Al Qaeda no longer 
		has run of the country; the Taliban is routed; there's an elected 
		parliament and a president dedicated to democratic institutions.The doctrine still stands: 
		If you harbor a terrorist, you're equally as guilty as the terrorists 
		who commit murder.Thirdly -- and this is very 
		important for the students to understand, and others -- because oceans 
		no longer protect us, the United States of America must confront threats 
		before they cause us harm. In other words, in the old days we could see 
		a threat and say, well, maybe it will cause harm, maybe it won't. Those 
		days changed, as far as I'm concerned. Threats must be taken seriously 
		now, because geography doesn't protect us and there's an enemy that 
		still lurks. And so early in my first term, I looked at the world and 
		saw a threat in Saddam Hussein. And let me tell you why I saw the 
		threat.First of all, there was an 
		immediate threat because he was shooting at our airplanes. There was 
		what's called no-fly zones; that meant the Iraqis couldn't fly in the 
		zones, and we were patrolling with British pilots. And he was firing at 
		us, which was a threat -- a threat to the life and limb of the troops to 
		whom I'm the Commander-in-Chief. He was a state sponsor of terror. In 
		other words, the government had declared, you are a state sponsor of 
		terror. And, remember, we're dealing with terrorist networks that would 
		like to do us harm.There's a reason why he was 
		declared a state sponsor of terror -- because he was sponsoring terror. 
		He had used weapons of mass destruction. And the biggest threat that 
		this President, and future Presidents, must worry about is weapons of 
		mass destruction getting in the hands of a terrorist network that would 
		like to do us harm. That is the biggest threat we face. Airplanes were 
		horrible; the attacks of aircraft were horrible. But the damage done 
		could be multiplied if weapons of mass destruction were in the hands of 
		these people.The world thought Saddam 
		Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. It wasn't just me or my 
		administration. Our predecessor thought he had weapons of mass 
		destruction. And there's a logical reason why -- the data showed that he 
		likely had weapons of mass destruction, and he'd use them. I told you, 
		the last option for a President is to send troops into combat, and I was 
		hoping that we could solve the issue, the threat, the threat to the 
		United States by diplomatic means.So I went to the United 
		Nations. Secretary Powell carried our message to the United Nations. It 
		said --- see, now, I actually gave a speech to the United Nations, you 
		might remember, and I said to them, basically, how many resolutions is 
		it going to take before this threat will take us seriously? I mean, we 
		passed, I don't know, 14, 15 different resolutions. That's a lot of 
		resolutions. Pretty soon, if you pass that many resolutions, somebody is 
		going to say, well, they may not mean anything. I want this body to be 
		effective. It's important for the world, when it speaks, that people 
		listen.And so we passed another 
		resolution that said that Saddam is in -- and it unanimously passed, and 
		the reason why is because the world thought he was a danger. It said: 
		disarm, disclose, or face serious consequences. I'm the kind of fellow, 
		when I -- when we say something, I mean it, like I told you before. And 
		I meant it.And so Saddam Hussein was 
		given a choice. He chose war. And so we moved and he was removed from 
		power. And there is absolutely no doubt in my mind, America is safer for 
		it, and the world is better off without Saddam Hussein.A lot of people, I 
		understand, disagreed with that decision, and that's what democracy is 
		all about, that's what we believe in. We believe you can disagree. 
		There's a custom in our country for people to express themselves, and 
		it's good. It's what makes us a great country, that people can stand up 
		and tell people what's on their mind. And we're going to keep it that 
		way. It's very important for those who didn't agree with the decision, 
		though, to understand the consequences of success in Iraq. It's really 
		important we succeed, for a lot of reasons.And the definition of 
		success, by the way, is for there to be a country where the terrorists 
		and Saddamists can no longer threaten the democracy, and where Iraqi 
		security forces can provide for the security of their people, and where 
		Iraq is not a safe haven from which the terrorists -- al Qaeda and its 
		affiliates -- can plot attacks against America.We got a strategy, and I'm 
		going to keep talking about the strategy -- it will yield a victory. And 
		the strategy is political security and economic in nature. In economic, 
		we're going to help them rebuild their country, help secure their oil 
		supply so they'll have cash flow in order to invest in their people.On the political front, 
		you've seen it -- you've seen what happened in one year's time. It's 
		just amazing, I think. I guess, we take it for granted -- some of us do. 
		I don't. The fact that people have gone from living under the clutches 
		of a tyrant who ordered the murder of thousands of his own citizens, to 
		a society in which people last year started voting -- voting for an 
		interim government, voting for a constitution, and then voting for a 
		permanent government under the new constitution. The government is now 
		-- they're beginning to form.In other words, you're 
		seeing a lot of sharp elbows, probably kind of like American politics 
		seem to some people, a lot of throwing of sharp elbows. You didn't see a 
		lot of elbows, political elbows being thrown under the tyrant, did you? 
		That's because tyrants don't allow for the political process to evolve. 
		But we're watching the political process evolve, made complicated by the 
		fact that the terrorists still want to cause destruction and death as 
		this government is forming to try to stop it.We got to step back and ask 
		why. Why would they want to stop democracy? And the answer, because 
		democracy stands for the exact opposite of their vision. Liberty is not 
		their credo. And they understand a defeat to their ideology by the 
		establishment of a free Iraq will be a devastating blow for their 
		vision.And so the Iraqis are 
		showing incredible courage. When somebody says, if you vote, I'm going 
		to get you, sometimes people maybe say, well, maybe I don't want to 
		vote. Eleven million or so Iraqis went to the polls in defiance of these 
		killers. It's a magical moment in the history of liberty.And then on the security 
		front, our strategy can be summed up this way: As the Iraqis stand up, 
		we'll stand down. Look, we want the Iraqis to be prepared to take the 
		fight to the enemy. Let me talk about the enemy real quick in Iraq. 
		There are what we call ""rejectionists."" These are Sunnis that kind of 
		like the fact that they -- even though a minority inside the country -- 
		had the upper hand for a long period of time with Saddam. And they're 
		worried about whether or not a constitution that says it will protect 
		minority rights actually will protect minority rights. But the good news 
		is, more and more Sunnis started to vote. And if you watch the news, 
		they're beginning to negotiate, they're beginning to see a better way. 
		In other words, the political process is beginning to marginalize the 
		remaining elements of those who are trying to stop the progress.One of those elements is 
		Saddamists. These are the thugs that kind of control the country. They 
		loved power; they don't want to give it up. And they'd like to return to 
		the good old days, which isn't going to happen.And the other group of 
		course, is the al Qaeda types, Mr. Zarqawi, who wants us to leave Iraq. 
		They want us to get out of Iraq so Iraq can be a safe haven. It is their 
		stated objective: Don't worry, take your time, keep killing the innocent 
		because America will lose its will. That's what the enemy has said. 
		That's their words.The way to defeat the enemy 
		is for the political process to marginalize the rejectionists, and for 
		us to train the Iraqi forces so they can find the few that want to dash 
		the hopes of the many, and that's what we're doing.Our strategy is twofold: 
		We're on the hunt for the terrorists, and we're training Iraqis. And 
		we're making decent progress. There are more and more Iraqi units in the 
		fight. There's more and more country being turned over to the Iraqis. We 
		got a lot of bases around Iraq, and more of those bases are being given 
		to the Iraqi troops.This is the year that we'll 
		not only continue to focus on the troops, we'll continue to train Iraqi 
		police. We've seen some problems about what it means to have lived in a 
		society where people want to seek revenge. In other words, they use 
		their police -- status as a police person to take it out on others 
		because of past grievances. That's not acceptable to the United States 
		of America. And it's not acceptable to most Iraqis, either.And so part of the training 
		for police is not only to give them the capacity to handle the enemy, 
		but to make sure they understand human rights and ethics involved with 
		police work. And so that's what you'll be seeing. You're going to see 
		more Iraqi troops in the fight, and more police providing security. And 
		as a result, our commanders on the ground informed me that they thought 
		we could reduce our troop level from the 168,000 that were there -- 
		165,000, more or less, that were there for the election -- below 
		138,000.Now, I want to emphasize something to you, you heard me say, ""our 
		commanders on the ground said."" You see, sometimes in the political 
		process people feel beholden to polls and focus groups. You don't have 
		to worry about me. I'm going to be listening to the people that know 
		what they're talking about, and that's the commanders on the ground in 
		Iraq.  They'll make 
		the decisions. They will give the advice. Conditions on the ground will 
		dictate our force levels over the next year, but the strategy is what I 
		said it is: We'll stay on the offense, and we'll give these brave Iraqis 
		the skills and training necessary to defend their own democracy.Look, this enemy cannot beat 
		us. They cannot defeat us militarily. There's no chance. The one weapon 
		they have, which is a lethal weapon, is the willingness to kill people. 
		I remember the story -- and it just broke my heart to think about the 
		young soldier that was giving candy to a kid, and they set off the car 
		bomb next to the kids. I mean, it's just -- I cannot describe to you how 
		brutal these people are. And they understand that their scenes will get 
		on TV. And I don't know if they can adequately understand the compassion 
		of the American people. But we're compassionate.I told you one of the great 
		beliefs of our country is every life matters, every person counts -- 
		whether it be a child here in America, or a child in Iraq. And they 
		understand. And so part of my decision-making process is to understand 
		the strength of the enemy -- the only strength they have -- and continue 
		to remind the people that is their only strength, and the only way we 
		can lose is if we lose our nerve and our will. The American people are 
		resolute. They are strong. And we're not going to lose our will to these 
		thugs and murderers.In there long-term -- in the 
		short-term, we'll stay on the offense; in the long-term, the way to 
		defeat these people is to spread liberty. As you study history, I want 
		you to watch the effects of freedom around the world. One of my favorite 
		ways to describe my belief in the capacity of freedom to help achieve 
		peace -- not only security for the American people, but peace -- is to 
		give people the example of my dad and me, in terms of Japan.My dad was an 18-year-old 
		kid and went to fight the Japanese. I promise you, a lot of folks here, 
		relatives, did the same thing. They were called into action because the 
		enemy had attacked us. They were the sworn enemy of the United States of 
		America. It was a brutal war against the Japanese. Took a lot of lives 
		-- Japanese lives and American lives -- to win that war. And, today, 
		like my recent trip to the Far East, I sit down with Prime Minister 
		Koizumi, who is the Japanese Prime Minister, and talk about the peace. 
		Now, think about that. I particularly want the students to think about 
		what took place when 18-year-old President 41 was fighting the Japanese, 
		and 59-year-old 43 -- that would be me -- is talking to the Prime 
		Minister of the former enemy about peace. And you know what took place? 
		A Japanese-style democracy came to be.History has shown that 
		democracies yield the peace. Europe is free, whole, and at peace because 
		the nations are democratic. That wasn't always the case, obviously, in 
		the 1900s. Two major wars were fought where a lot of Americans died, and 
		yet systems and forms of government changed. And now Europe is 
		completely different, in terms of security and peace. The Far East -- I 
		just mentioned the Japanese example. And that's what the enemy 
		understands, and that's why they're so brutal and relentless. They 
		understand the march of peace will be contagious. Part of my 
		decision-making process is my firm belief in the natural rights of men 
		and women; my belief that deep in everybody's soul is the desire to live 
		free. I believe there's an Almighty, and I believe the Almighty's great 
		gift to each man and woman in this world is the desire to be free. This 
		isn't America's gift to the world, it is a universal gift to the world, 
		and people want to be free.And if you believe that, and 
		if you believe freedom yields the peace, it's important for the United 
		States of America, with friends, to lead the cause of liberty. I'm not 
		saying to any country, you must have a democracy that looks like 
		America. I am saying, free your people, understand that liberty is 
		universal, and help lay that foundation of peace for generations to 
		come. Some day an American President will be sitting down with elected 
		leaders from a country like Iraq talking about how to keep the peace. 
		This generation is rising to the challenge. We're looking at history, we 
		understand our values, and we're laying that foundation of peace for 
		generations to come.We've also got to be 
		diligent here at home. I'm getting ready to answer some questions. Laura 
		said, whatever you do, don't get too windy.We've created the Department 
		of Homeland Security. We reorganized our intelligence services. I want 
		you to know that every morning, I meet with the Director of National 
		Intelligence or his Deputy, sometimes with the head of the CIA, and 
		always with a briefer, CIA briefer that comes and gives me the latest 
		intelligence and the analysis of intelligence. That's every morning in 
		the White House, except for Sunday.And the reason I do is 
		because I told you early that my job is not to be complacent, my job is 
		to be on the lookout -- along with a lot of other people, I want you to 
		know. We've got 800,000 state and first responders that have been 
		trained; security is strong at the airports. I hope they stop taking off 
		the shoes of the elderly. I must confess, they haven't taken off my 
		shoes lately at the airport.We're doing a lot of stuff, 
		but I want to talk about two tools necessary to protect you. First, 
		before September the 11th, our law enforcement and intelligence services 
		weren't able to share information. For example, within the FBI, you had 
		your law enforcement division and your intelligence division -- and for 
		a lot of reasons, if they had information about a potential terrorist, 
		they couldn't share it. That's hard to fathom, but it's the truth. There 
		was a wall built up, and there's a lot of reasons why the wall was built 
		up -- some of it historical, obviously, legal ramifications.And I didn't think you could 
		ask our front-line officers to defend us if they didn't have all the 
		tools necessary to share intelligence, and to share information -- by 
		the way, tools which have been granted to use in tracking down drug 
		dealers, for example. My attitude was, if it's good enough -- these 
		tools are good enough to find a drug dealer, then they ought to be good 
		enough to protect us from the new threats of the 21st century.And so the Congress passed 
		what's called the Patriot Act by a huge majority. They saw the threat, 
		and they said, wait a minute, let's make sure that if we ask the 
		administration, and, more importantly, people in the administration to 
		defend us, let's give them the tools necessary to defend us. 
		Interestingly enough, the Patriot Act, some of its provisions are set to 
		expire. I like to remind people the Patriot Act may be set to expire, 
		but the threats to the United States haven't expired. And exactly what 
		has changed, I asked out loud, after the attack of September the 11th 
		and today? Those tools are still needed for our law enforcement 
		officers. I want you to know that this Patriot Act is under constant 
		review, and there has been no documented abuses under the Patriot Act.In other words, Congress, in 
		its wisdom, when it passed the Act, said, we'll make sure that the civil 
		liberties of the United States are protected as we give the tools to 
		those who are asked to take the fight to the enemy, to protect us. 
		Congress extended this Patriot Act to February 3rd. That's not good 
		enough for the American people, it seems like to me. When they get back 
		there, they need to make sure they extend all aspects of the Patriot Act 
		to protect the American people.The threat still exists, is 
		my message to members of both political parties. The tools -- if they 
		were important right after September the 11th, they're still important 
		in 2006. The enemy has not gone away.Let me talk about one other 
		program -- and then I promise to answer questions -- something that 
		you've been reading about in the news lately. It's what I would call a 
		""terrorist surveillance program."" After the enemy attacked us, and after I 
		realized that we were not protected by oceans, I asked people that work 
		for you -- work for me, how best can we use information to protect the 
		American people? You might remember there was hijackers here that had 
		made calls outside the country to somebody else, prior to the September 
		the 11th attacks. And I said, is there anything more we can do within 
		the law, within the Constitution, to protect the American people. And 
		they came back with a program, designed a program that I want to 
		describe to you. And I want people here to clearly understand why I made 
		the decision I made.First, I made the decision 
		to do the following things because there's an enemy that still wants to 
		harm the American people. What I'm talking about is the intercept of 
		certain communications emanating between somebody inside the United 
		States and outside the United States; and one of the numbers would be 
		reasonably suspected to be an al Qaeda link or affiliate. In other 
		words, we have ways to determine whether or not someone can be an al 
		Qaeda affiliate or al Qaeda. And if they're making a phone call in the 
		United States, it seems like to me we want to know why.This is a -- I repeat to 
		you, even though you hear words, ""domestic spying,"" these are not phone 
		calls within the United States. It's a phone call of an al Qaeda, known 
		al Qaeda suspect, making a phone call into the United States. I'm 
		mindful of your civil liberties, and so I had all kinds of lawyers 
		review the process. We briefed members of the United States Congress, 
		one of whom was Senator Pat Roberts, about this program. You know, it's 
		amazing, when people say to me, well, he was just breaking the law -- if 
		I wanted to break the law, why was I briefing Congress?Federal courts have 
		consistently ruled that a President has authority under the Constitution 
		to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance against our enemies. 
		Predecessors of mine have used that same constitutional authority. 
		Recently there was a Supreme Court case called theHamdicase. It ruled 
		the authorization for the use of military force passed by the Congress 
		in 2001 -- in other words, Congress passed this piece of legislation. 
		And the Court ruled, the Supreme Court ruled that it gave the President 
		additional authority to use what it called ""the fundamental incidents of 
		waging war"" against al Qaeda.I'm not a lawyer, but I can 
		tell you what it means. It means Congress gave me the authority to use 
		necessary force to protect the American people, but it didn't prescribe 
		the tactics. It's an -- you've got the power to protect us, but we're 
		not going to tell you how. And one of the ways to protect the American 
		people is to understand the intentions of the enemy. I told you it's a 
		different kind of war with a different kind of enemy. If they're making 
		phone calls into the United States, we need to know why -- to protect 
		you.And that's the world in 
		which you live. I view it as a chance for an historic opportunity to 
		make this place better for your children and your grandchildren -- ""this 
		place"" being the world. I'm just confident that if we don't lose our 
		will, and stay strong, and that as that liberty advances, people may 
		look back at this lecture and other speeches by people who profess the 
		same devotion to freedom that I've had, and say, you know, maybe they're 
		just right. Maybe America, that was founded on natural rights of men and 
		women is a ticket for peace. Maybe that kind of view -- that every 
		person matters, that there are such things as human dignity and the 
		basic freedoms that we feel, that becomes a huge catalyst for change for 
		the better.These troops are defending 
		you with all their might, but at the same time, they're beginning to 
		help change that world by spreading liberty and freedom.It's such an honor to be the 
		President of the great country that we are during such historic times, 
		and I want to thank you for giving me a chance to describe to you some 
		of the decision-making processes I've used to do my duty to defend the 
		American people.God bless.Be glad to answer some 
		questions if you've got some. Thank you. I think there's some people 
		with microphones and all that, that are going to be out there. Anybody 
		has any questions, any boys from the Last Chance Bar got any questions?Question:Mr. President.President Bush:Thank you, 
		yes. Yes, ma'am.Question:Mr. President, we salute 
		what you have done, your aggressive stance on terrorism. But more than 
		that, as you know, Kansas is a beef state. The number one industry in 
		the state of Kansas is beef production and beef processing. A strong 
		beef industry indicates a strong Kansas, and it affects all of us. We 
		sincerely appreciate your efforts in regaining our markets with Japan, 
		your aggressive stance on trade. We support that tremendously. I wonder 
		if you would just comment on what's happened recently.President Bush:Yes, well, 
		thanks. Thank you for your leadership. We think we grow pretty good beef 
		in Texas, too. Now is not the time to compare, of course.Look, here's the thing. 
		There's an interesting debate in the United States about markets, about 
		whether or not we should aggressively seek markets or whether or not we 
		should become protectionists. Protectionism means tariffs and policies 
		that make it difficult for people to trade in the United States and for 
		people in the United States to trade outside the United States. I'm a 
		big believer in opening markets. There's a practical reason why. One is 
		that, we're 5 percent of the people, which means -- in the world -- that 
		means 95 percent of the people are potential customers for U.S. farmers 
		and ranchers and small businesses and entrepreneurs. And so, what Madam 
		President -- former President is referring to is that I have been very 
		aggressive about opening up markets through trade agreements.Yet I'm a little concerned 
		about trade agreements, though, because it's more and more difficult to 
		get them passed out of the United States Congress. It seems like they're 
		becoming so political that people either are becoming protectionist or 
		lose sight -- are losing sight of the value about opening markets.Look, if you're a cattle 
		raiser in Kansas, you want to be able to sell your product in Japan or 
		South Korea or China. I mean, people want the beef. And the problem 
		we've recently had, as you mentioned, reflects what is necessary to make 
		sure that trade works. And that is, if there are problems, like in this 
		case, some beef coming out of Brooklyn, I think it was, and if the 
		Japanese balk at opening their markets, we have got to be aggressive 
		about explaining to people why our beef is safe. And so part of being -- 
		part of making sure that the ranchers in this case see the benefits of 
		open markets is when a market gets open, to work hard to make sure that 
		market stays open if there happens to be a problem -- or a short-term 
		problem.Secondly, is to make sure 
		that we're treated fairly. And that part -- when you see me arguing for 
		trade agreements, a lot of times it means that a country is getting a 
		better deal from us than we are from them. All I'm saying is, look, just 
		treat us the way we treat you. If we open up our markets for your 
		product, you open your markets for our products.And so my -- and I believe, 
		and this is going to sound -- let me just say to people as you study the 
		economics of how to make sure this economy continues to grow, one way to 
		do it is to make sure the markets are available, that there be a level 
		playing field. I believe we can compete with anybody, anytime, anywhere, 
		so long as it's fair.And obviously one area where 
		we're trying to keep those markets open is when it comes to beef. And we 
		had the BSE, and one of the jobs of the federal government is to respond 
		quickly to the BSE issue, is to try the settle people's nerves down so 
		we can get those markets reopened. And when I went to see Prime Minister 
		Koizumi, as well as President Roh in South Korea, one of the items I 
		discussed was, you're missing out on some Kansas beef.Question:Thank you, Mr. President. 
		One of the things that most of our Senate delegation has worked 
		tirelessly on is the situation in the Sudan. Sudan was, of course, 
		slated to be the chair of the African Union next year, which is -- they 
		have tried, much like the United Nations, to do something. Does the 
		United States have a larger role to play in the Sudan, and the entire 
		sub-Saharan African region?President Bush:Yes, great 
		question. We have played an active -- first of all, I do want to thank 
		both Senators. I'm on treacherous ground here to kind of credit one 
		versus the other, but I guess I will, since one of them is going to want 
		a free meal going back to Washington. I guess both. Sam, I mean -- 
		Roberts is great on the issue, and Sam is the person I've been 
		interfacing with the most, frankly, in the whole United States Senate, 
		about his deep concern for life in the Sudan. Matter of fact, in the 
		vehicle driving over here, he brought the issue up.We have got an important 
		role to play and have played it. I don't know if you remember the 
		Danforth commission, where Jack Danforth, the former senator from 
		Missouri, was my envoy to the Sudan to help resolve the north-south 
		conflict. And there was a peace agreement in place. And the peace 
		agreement was set back, unfortunately, because -- well, it's still 
		intact, don't get me wrong, but the implementation was delayed somewhat 
		because of John Garang's untimely death. He was the leader of the south 
		of Sudan. So the important thing there is that we showed through 
		diplomacy that it's possible to resolve differences, and to begin to 
		reduce the abhorrent issue of slavery.As you now know, the issue 
		in Sudan is -- and by the way, one of the great strengths of this 
		country is our faith-based programs that rose up in indignation about 
		the slavery that was taking place in the Sudan. Much of the first wave 
		of help that went into the Sudan, some of it was government, most of it 
		was the response of the private sector, particularly the religious 
		communities.The issue now is Darfur. And 
		when Colin was still the Secretary of State, he declared the policy of 
		the U.S. and our deep concern that we are headed toward genocide. I 
		think we're the only nation that has uttered those words thus far in 
		Darfur. The strategy -- and it's a very complex situation. It would take 
		yet another lecture to give you all the kind of ins and outs. But 
		suffice it to say that we are deeply concerned about poor folks who have 
		been run out of their villages into refugee camps, who are still being 
		threatened by a jinjaweed militia and some rebellious groups that are 
		trying to extract political gain through marauding and death and rape 
		and destruction.We've empowered the AU, and 
		this is what your question really kind of -- part of your question leads 
		to -- to provide forces on the ground, to provide stability. And what 
		he's referring to is that the Sudanese government is going to be the 
		head of the African Union -- that's what AU stands for -- which would 
		then put them the titular head of the troops on the ground. And, 
		obviously, that should be of concern -- concern to us. It is a concern 
		to us, and it should be a concern to the AU nations.That issue has yet to be 
		resolved as to whether or not Sudan will be the AU. This is an important 
		issue. We will continue to work with Congress to provide aid, food aid 
		and help. We helped fly the AU troops into Sudan. We're watching it very 
		carefully. We are considering different strategies as to how to make 
		sure that there's enough protection at least to get people help and 
		protection, and, at the same time, see if we can't try to broker the 
		same kind of agreement we did north-south, with the Darfur and the 
		government. Thank you for asking the question.Yes, sir.Question:What is your position, or 
		would you comment on a long-term strategy with respect to the 
		geopolitical ambitions of China and Iran?President Bush:Yes, great 
		question. First, let me start with Iran. I'm deeply concerned about 
		Iran, as should a lot of people be concerned about Iran. I'm concerned, 
		when the country of Iran, their president announces his desire to see 
		that Israel gets destroyed. Israel is our ally. We're committed to the 
		safety of Israel, and it's a commitment we will keep.Secondly, I'm concerned 
		about a non-transparent society's desire to develop a nuclear weapon. 
		The world cannot be put in a position where we can be blackmailed by a 
		nuclear weapon. I believe it is very important for the Iranian 
		government to hear loud and clear from not only the United States, but 
		also from other nations around the world. I also want the Iranian people 
		to hear loud and clear, and that is, we have no beef with you. We are 
		worried about a government that is not transparent whose aims and 
		objectives are not peaceful. And, therefore, we don't think that you 
		should have the capacity to make a nuclear weapon.The diplomatic strategy is 
		being led right now by what's called the EU3 -- France, Germany and 
		Great Britain -- and they're doing a good job of keeping together a 
		common message to say to the Iranians that we expect you to adhere to 
		international norm. The next logical step if the Iranians continue not 
		to adhere to international norm or the demands of the free world is to 
		go to the United Nations Security Council.At the same time, the 
		development of an Iraqi democracy is an important message to people 
		inside of Iran. I told you what I believe. I believe everybody desires 
		to be free. I believe women want to be treated equally. And I think that 
		a message of democracy and freedom in that part of the world will 
		embolden reformers. But this is a serious issue.China is -- we have a 
		complex relationship with China. Unlike with Iran, which we sanctioned a 
		long time ago, we've got a lot of relations with China. We've got trade 
		relations with China. We have got diplomatic relations with China. I've 
		met with the Chinese leadership quite often, and will tell you my 
		personal relations with Hu Jintao are warm, warm enough to be able to 
		sit with him in private and talk about things that matter to me. And one 
		thing that matters to me is the freedom of the Chinese people.I think any time in the 
		diplomatic arena, you want the President to be in a position where he 
		can have a relationship where you can speak with candor and your words 
		can be heard, as opposed to a relationship that gets so tense and so 
		off-putting because of distrust. Nobody likes to be lectured in the 
		public arena, let me put it to you that way. I don't like it, and I'm 
		sure other leaders don't like it. And so I've worked hard to make sure 
		that my personal diplomacy is such that I'm able to make certain points 
		with the Chinese.One such point is that, you 
		know, treat us the way we treat you. You've got a trade imbalance with 
		the United States. And if we don't get it under control, there could be 
		a backlash here. And, therefore, we expect you to treat our products the 
		same way we treat you. And by the way, if you happen to dump -- choose 
		to dump products, like in textiles, we'll hold you to account under the 
		law.I talk about their currency 
		with the Chinese. You've got to let your currency float. The market 
		currency ought to be priced through market, not by government edict, 
		which is -- they're beginning to move a little bit on the currency, if 
		you're paying attention to the issue.Now, I went to church in 
		China. And I was a little nervous, at first, frankly, about a licensed 
		church. I wasn't sure whether or not I was going to go to a church or 
		not a church, and went -- Laura and I went with a guy namedLuis Palau. And I was impressed by the spirit I felt in the 
		church. And after it was over, I told Hu Jintao, I said, you know, I'm a 
		religious person, and the more free religion is in your country, the 
		better off your society will be, and you shouldn't fear the church. You 
		ought to come to the church. You know, you ought to see what I saw, 
		which is peaceful people honoring something greater than themselves.I would hope that China will 
		continue to move in the -- or move in the direction of human dignity. I 
		talked to him about, of course, the Dalai Lama; talked to him about the 
		Catholic Church's inability to get their bishops in. In other words, 
		what I do is I press the freedom issue. We don't always agree with 
		China, of course. It's a complex relationship, but it's one in which, in 
		my judgment, it's best to be in a position where we can dialogue and 
		discuss things in order to keep relations on keel and keep peace in that 
		part of the world.It's really interesting, do 
		you realize that it takes China 25 million new jobs a year to stay even. 
		Think about that -- I'm out there blowing when we get 4 million in the 
		past -- since April of 2003 -- this guy needs to get 25 million a year.  And Sam and I and Pat, and the Governor were talking about 
		the Chinese demand for energy. One reason they've got such a huge demand 
		for energy is because they've got to grow their economy, 25 million 
		people a year. And their economy is just beginning to modernize, so 
		they're using a lot of raw materials. I'm kind of wandering here, but -- 
		which says two things to me, by the way -- it's called a filibuster -- 
		it says we've got to diversify away from hydrocarbons in the United 
		States of America.When we were driving through 
		the beautiful country coming here, I told the Governor and I told the 
		two senators I firmly believe a day is coming when we're going to be 
		able to grow saw grass and convert that into energy. And, secondly, 
		we've got to share technology with China so that they become better 
		users of energy and better protectors of the environment. It's a complex 
		relationship that we spend a lot of time thinking about. And I 
		appreciate your question very much. Hu Jintao is coming, I think, here 
		pretty soon to the United States. And as I say, I enjoy my visits -- 
		personal visits with him.Yes, ma'am.Question:Hello, Mr. President. I am 
		an American Iraqi Kurd. I would like to salute you and salute all the 
		troops are freeing 27 million people. They are free.President Bush:Thank you.Question:Mr. President, I would 
		like to share this thought with all our nation and everybody who is 
		questioning what happened to the chemical weapons. Saddam burned 4,500 
		villagers. I lost more than 10 members of my family under the ground. We 
		found their bones after, when we freed Iraq. Saddam, himself, and his 
		people, his followers, they are chemical weapons. Please stop 
		questioning the administration and their decision. It was the best 
		decision anybody could take. Freeing 27 million people.President Bush:Okay, this is 
		a question and answer period.Question:Mr. President --President Bush:I hate to cut 
		you off. You're on a roll, but what's the question?Question:Mr. President, all I could 
		tell you, I have two members of my family, they are in the Iraqi 
		parliament. And both of them are women. My sister-in-law and my aunt, 
		they are in the Iraqi parliament. And I would like you to share this 
		happiness with me and with all the Iraqi people. Thank you, Mr. 
		President.President Bush:Thank you. 
		And here's my message -- here's my message to your relatives in the 
		Iraqi parliament: Work to form a unity government, a government that 
		includes the minorities in the country -- a Shia, Kurd, and Sunni -- no, 
		no, no -- no, no. Thank you -- laughter.Question:My husband is Sunni. My 
		mother-in-law was a Christian, Catholic --President Bush:All right --Question:I have two kids --President Bush:Thank you. 
		Got a question? Only in America. Hold on.Question:I'm from the United 
		Kingdom.President Bush:Welcome.Question:Thank you. Although I 
		might be living here for a while now, and you haven't kicked me out, and 
		I thank you very much for that --President Bush:Write your 
		senator. Anyway, go ahead.Question:Us British, were a 
		querulous people and we know that we're one of your greatest supporters 
		in the world, and Tony Blair, who I have the greatest respect for, is my 
		leader. When you say, ""jump,"" he says, ""how high?"" At least, that's the 
		perception of many of the British people. And when he agrees and does 
		your bidding, then it weakens him on the home front at home. And many 
		people enjoy this, but some of the more vocal ones will say, he's a 
		yes-man. Have you discussed that with him, and do you have any --President Bush:I appreciate 
		that a lot. First, I'm aware that that is a criticism of Tony, and I 
		just strongly disagree with that. Frankly, it's demeaning to his 
		character and his strength of conviction. But I've heard the criticism, 
		and it's just simply not the case.Like you, I admire him a 
		lot. He's an independent thinker. He and I share this interesting moment 
		in history together, and we also share this deep belief that liberty 
		will transform the world -- it can transform the world. That's what we 
		believe. In other words, there is a philosophical core of Tony Blair 
		that I -- belief, core beliefs that Tony and I share.You know, sometimes we 
		disagree on tactics. We try to work through what we -- we've had a lot 
		of disagreements. I mean, a classic came on the Kyoto treaty. You might 
		remember the treaty. I said I just wasn't going to support it. I didn't 
		think it was good for the American economy; I thought there was a better 
		way to go about being good stewards of the environment. He disagreed 
		with me. There's a series of issues where we -- international criminal 
		court is another good example. I think the international criminal court 
		is something we shouldn't join. I just don't want unelected prosecutors 
		prosecuting our troops or our diplomats in a court overseas. Tony 
		disagreed strongly.I can give you a series of 
		examples where -- but we agree strategically. And that's what's 
		important. Look, I'm sorry that his relationship with me causes him 
		political problems at home. Sometimes I can be a little allergic for 
		people overseas, if you know what I mean.  But I think I 
		would classify our relationship as historic. You don't know this -- I'm 
		about to tell you something interesting -- that we talk once a week, or 
		try to. And it's a really interesting way to share just thoughts and 
		concerns. And the British-U.S. relationship is unique. It's been unique 
		in the past, it is unique today, and I'm convinced it will be unique in 
		the future, for the good of the world.But, no, I'm very aware of 
		the political difficulties he's faced. By the way, when you make hard 
		decisions, like Tony has made, and, frankly, I've made, it creates 
		angst. I mean, the easy route would have been to do nothing and just 
		hope for the best. And that's why I admire Tony. Tony is a person of 
		great courage.I can remember -- I'll tell 
		you an anecdote -- you didn't even ask, and I'm going to tell you. And 
		it's been published in a book a guy wrote in Washington. Tony was very 
		worried about his government. You might remember when the second 
		resolution -- we had the first resolution; then there was an argument 
		about what ""serious consequences"" meant -- I guess that's what the 
		problem was. I kind of knew what it meant. He knew what it meant. 
		Others, all of a sudden, had a different view of ""serious consequences"" 
		when Saddam chose to not deal squarely with the world and not deal with 
		the inspectors. He was worried about his government, and so was I. And I 
		told him one time, I said, if you're worried about your government -- I 
		said, you don't want your government to fall, and if you're worried 
		about it, just go ahead and pull out of the coalition, so you can save 
		your government.And he said to me, he said, 
		I'm going to -- he said, I have made my commitment on behalf of the 
		great country of Britain, and I'm not changing my mind. Basically, what 
		he told me, he said, George, he said, politics -- I'm not interested in 
		politics; what I'm interested in is doing the right thing. And that's 
		why I admire Tony Blair; he'll do the right thing.Good question. Yes, sir.Question:I have a question less 
		with politics and more with leadership, in general. You're in a 
		situation where you're under a lot of flack, especially for your 
		character. And that's something that, it seems to me, means a lot to 
		you, as it does to many of us here. As a leader, as many of us are going 
		to need to know here because we're going to be leaders in just a few 
		years, what's the best way that you go about preparing yourself for 
		attacks on your character, and how do you deal with others in those 
		matters?President Bush:Yes, I 
		appreciate that. I would summarize it: faith, family and friends. I am 
		sustained mightily by the fact that millions of citizens -- for whom 
		I'll never get to thank personally -- pray for me. It's hard for me to 
		describe why I feel that way, why I'm so sustained. I guess it's just 
		called faith. And I'm sustained by my family. And there's nothing better 
		than going home to somebody who understands and is sympathetic and is 
		part of -- we're working together. I mean, Laura's job is just as 
		important as mine in many ways.The girls still love me. I 
		really love them. And then there's my man, Barney, a little Scottish 
		terrier.  I say this -- and Laura will be furious at me -- 
		he's the son I never had, you know?I believe in what I'm doing. 
		And I understand politics, and it can get rough. I read a lot of 
		history, by the way, and Abraham Lincoln had it rough. I'm not comparing 
		myself to Abraham Lincoln, nor should you think just because I mentioned 
		his name in the context of my presidency -- I would never do that. He 
		was a great President. But, boy, they mistreated him. He did what he 
		thought was right.A lot of politicians, a lot 
		of Presidents have gone through some tough times in the presidency, and 
		I understand that. One of my biggest disappointments is the tone in 
		Washington, D.C. I've done my best to try to elevate the tone. I just -- 
		needless name-calling, to me, is beneath the dignity of the office of 
		the President. I also make time in my day not only for prayer, but also 
		-- and my family, but also for exercise. I found that part of keeping a 
		positive outlook is to kind of burn off that excess energy, you know 
		what I'm saying? I work out, I try to work out five or six days a week. 
		It's really important -- if you feel that's important for your life, to 
		schedule your life. In other words, I have trouble with people saying, 
		I'm so busy I can't exercise. I don't think you're too busy for things 
		that are important in your life, and you can figure out ways to make 
		time in your life.And so I'm the kind of guy 
		-- I'm not running too well these days; I'm not running hardly at all. 
		It's kind of like my knees are like tires, you know, and they're bald. 
		I'm a mountain bike guy. And it's a fantastic experience.I think to answer your -- 
		summarize your question, is to make sure that you've got good priorities 
		in your life. By having good priorities in your life, it helps you keep 
		perspective on your life. And perspective is very important, as you 
		assume responsibility. Thanks for the question.Yes, ma'am.Question:Mr. President, thank you 
		for being here. I served under your father, he was my Commander-in-Chief 
		in Desert Storm. And it was with great interest that I followed your 
		campaign; my husband and I both are great fans of yours. I thank you for 
		making the hard decisions, for making -- not listening to the critics 
		and keeping your campaign promise.And I've been following the 
		confirmation hearings of Judge Alito. And I certainly hope he's 
		confirmed.President Bush:Well, I 
		appreciate that.Question:But I'd like to kind of 
		know how it stands right now.President Bush:Yes, what's 
		happening? First of all, I told the people -- and thank you for your 
		kind comments -- and I told the people when I ran for President I would 
		put people on the bench who would strictly interpret the Constitution. 
		In other words, not use their position to write law. We've got 
		legislators to write law; that's their job. The judges are to interpret 
		law.And Sam has been one of the 
		picks I made for the Supreme Court, Sam Alito. He's a very, very smart, 
		capable man. When you talk to Sam Alito, you think, smart judge. He's 
		written a lot of opinions. He has a judicial philosophy that is clear 
		and a judicial temperament that is sound. That's why the American Bar 
		Association gave him the highest possible rating. And now the question 
		is, will Sam Alito be given an up or down vote on the Senate floor.I don't know whether or not 
		in our history there's ever been a filibuster of a Supreme Court judge. 
		One years ago -- Sam, by the way, is on the Judiciary Committee and 
		helps conduct the hearings in a way that I thought has brought dignity 
		to the process.And so to answer your 
		question, I don't know. You hear gossip about a filibuster, meaning a 
		minority of Democrats --senators could stop Alito from getting a vote. 
		It would really -- I didn't mean to slip, I'm not trying to be -- I'm 
		not taking political shots. It just so happens that it would be the 
		Democrats who would try to not give him an up or down vote on the Senate 
		floor. I think he deserves an up or down vote. I believe that if given 
		an up or down vote, he'll be confirmed and the decision-making -- you 
		know, we're in the process now of hearing from the Democrat leadership.There are 14 senators, seven 
		from both political parties, who have vowed to try to prevent a 
		filibuster from taking place without extraordinary circumstances. In 
		other words, if there is extraordinary circumstance, they would agree to 
		a filibuster. There has been no sign of any extraordinary circumstance, 
		except for this extraordinary thing -- he's extraordinarily capable to 
		serve on the Supreme Court. And so thank you for your question on Sam. 
		It's going to come to a head here pretty soon. I think the vote in the 
		committee is -- Wednesday is the vote in the Judiciary? Tomorrow, yes. 
		You don't have to worry about it in the Committee. The floor will 
		proffer it later this week. That's great.Okay, a couple more and then 
		I've got to head back home. Yes, ma'am.Question:Hi. First I'd like to say 
		that when I was first able to cast my vote for President, it was my 
		honor to vote for you -- [inaudible]. Can you hear me?President Bush:I like that 
		part.Question:My question is about 
		Social Security.President Bush:Social 
		Security?Question:Yes. [Inaudible].President Bush:I couldn't 
		hear the question, so I'll put the words in your mouth. I guess you 
		asked is the system going to be viable when you get -- yes? No.If I were you, I'd pay 
		attention to the issue. And the reason why is because there's a lot of 
		us getting ready to retire. There's a baby boomer bulge. I was born in 
		'46, on the leading edge of what we call the baby boomers, and there's a 
		lot of us getting ready to retire, which means you are going to have to 
		pay for a lot more people in the system, plus we've been promised 
		greater benefits than the previous generation. So the system is going to 
		go broke unless we do something about it.Last year I talked about 
		doing something about it, and the Congress didn't do anything about it. 
		So this year I'm going to talk about doing something about it, and the 
		next year something about it, and the next year something about it. I 
		have a duty to confront problems and not hope, you know, just kind of 
		shuffle them along. And so this is a big issue; both Medicare and Social 
		Security are big issues. They're big issues for long-term deficits, and 
		they're big issues for the individuals who are going to be having to pay 
		in the system for people like me. And the fix isn't all that hard.What is first required is 
		people setting aside needless politics in Washington, D.C. and saying, 
		why don't we come together and get something done for the sake of a 
		future generation. And we can make sure that this generation -- that the 
		up-and-coming generation -- see, nothing changes if you're over 55. It's 
		the young people paying into a broke system. By the way, they call it a 
		Social Security trust, there's no ""trust."" The money is paid and it's 
		spent on other programs, and all that's left in the Social Security is 
		an IOU. And so it seems like to me that it's really important to kind of 
		lay out all the facts on the table for people to determine whether or 
		not there's a problem or not. And once they see a problem, then they 
		ought to be calling on people on the phone, their elected 
		representatives, saying, do something about it.And I believe we can fix 
		this problem by slowing down the rate of growth of benefits, not cutting 
		benefits. Benefits will increase. But the promises have been just too 
		great, and we need to be frank about it. We need to be open about it to 
		make sure that we save the Social Security system for our younger 
		generation.I also happen to believe we 
		have a fantastic opportunity to promote ownership in America. I believe 
		younger workers ought to be able to take some of their own money and set 
		it aside in a personal savings account. And the reason I believe that is 
		I think if you own an asset, it helps provide stability in American 
		society. I'm concerned that -- I'm concerned at the low rate of return 
		people get on their money through the Social Security -- you know, 
		supposed Social Security trust. I know the power of compounding rate of 
		interest. For those of you studying in economics, look it up. It says 
		money grows exponentially over time. And if you put your money in just a 
		safe series of instruments, it will grow. If you start saving at age 20, 
		it grows quite dramatically over time, and then that's your nest egg. 
		It's what you call -- it's a part of a Social Security benefit system. 
		Again, those of us who retire -- and I'm not talking about you, I'm 
		talking about younger workers being given an option.I'm also concerned about 
		people in our society who've never owned anything. You know, I'm worried 
		about -- and I know that if you own -- can you imagine a single mom 
		working and able to put some of the money aside for herself if she 
		wants, and watch that grow with just safe investments over time, and 
		when she retires, she's got a nest egg that she calls her own, that 
		government can't spend on another program, a nest egg that she can pass 
		on to her loved one.I mean, ownership and the 
		ability to pass wealth from one generation to the next is an important 
		part of busting the cycle of poverty, for example. And so this is a 
		great opportunity to think differently about this very important 
		program. And I appreciate you bringing it up, and thanks for being 
		concerned about it. You need to be.Yes, ma'am.Question:([Inaudible].President Bush:Do what?Question:[Inaudible].President Bush:Yes, I'll 
		look at it. Thank you. Appreciate it. Is your return address on there so 
		I can write you back? No? Okay. Make sure I get that.Question:Hi, I just want to get 
		your comments about education. Recently, $12.7 billion was cut from 
		education, and I was just wondering how that's supposed to help our 
		futures?President Bush:Education 
		budget was cut -- say it again. What was cut?Question:Twelve point seven billion 
		dollars was cut from education, and I was just wondering how is that 
		supposed to help our --President Bush:At the 
		federal level?Question:Yes.President Bush:I don't think 
		that -- I don't think we've actually -- for higher education? Student 
		loans?Question:Yes, student loans.President Bush:Actually, I 
		think what we did was reform the student loan program. We're not cutting 
		money out of it. In other words, people aren't going to be cut off the 
		program. We're just making sure it works better. Part of the 
		reconciliation package, I think she's talking about. Yes, it's a reform 
		of the program to make sure it functions better. It is -- in other 
		words, we're not taking people off student loans, we're saving money in 
		the student loan program because it's inefficient. And so I think the 
		thing to look at is whether or not there will be fewer people getting 
		student loans. I don't think so. And, secondly, on Pell grants, we're 
		actually expanding the number of Pell grants through our budget.But, great question. I think 
		that the key on education is to make sure that we stay focused on how do 
		we stay competitive into the 21st century. And I plan on doing some 
		talking about math and science and engineering programs, so that people 
		who graduate out of college will have the skills necessary to compete in 
		this competitive world.But I'm -- I think I'm right 
		on this. I'll check when I get back to Washington. But thank you for 
		your question.Yes, ma'am.Question:Again, I just wanted to 
		thank you for coming. Your speech was very good. I'm a big admirer of 
		your wife. I know that you said that your role as a President was as a 
		decision-maker, and I would like you to comment, please, on how your 
		wife contributes to your decision-making process, and how you confide in 
		her. Thank you.President Bush:Yes, thanks. 
		She's great. She keeps -- she tells me when I'm out of line.First of all, Laura pays 
		attention to what's going on. And so she offers her advice. And it's 
		sound advice. She's a West Texas woman, born and raised in West Texas. 
		Kind of a -- I would say she brings common sense. Kind of remind people 
		from here -- reminds me of people here from Kansas -- down-to-earth, no 
		airs, common-sense point of view. And so I appreciate very much when she 
		does give me her advice, which can be too frequent sometimes.  Not true, honey.It's like the time -- she 
		tells the story about the time when I was running for Congress in 1978 
		in West Texas, and she criticized one of my speeches. And I ran into the 
		garage door. But the best -- I guess the best way to describe it is, 
		one, I value her judgment, and I know it comes from her heart. And I 
		appreciate the perspective she brings. Common sense is just a very 
		important part of being a decision-maker. There is something reassuring 
		to me when I get advice from somebody who's got the best interests in 
		mind, got my best interest in mind, as well as just this kind of 
		down-to-earth read on the situation. And that's how I view my advice 
		from Laura.Plus, she does -- I mean, I 
		said some things -- ""wanted dead or alive"" -- and she said, you might be 
		able to explain that a little -- express yourself a little better than 
		that, George W. And so we've got a great relationship. You know, when I 
		married her, she really didn't like politics, didn't care particularly 
		for politicians either. And here she is the First Lady of the United 
		States. And she is good. Boy, I tell you, she's -- when she speaks, 
		she's very credible because she's a decent, credible person. And I love 
		her a lot.Yes. Is that a Washington 
		National hat?Question:Wisconsin, actually.President Bush:Okay, yes.Question:W is for Wisconsin. You're 
		a rancher. A lot of us here in Kansas are ranchers. I was just wanting 
		to get your opinion on ""Brokeback Mountain,"" if you've seen it yet? You 
		would love it. You should check it out.President Bush:I haven't 
		seen it. I'll be glad to talk about ranching, but I haven't seen the 
		movie. I've heard about it. I hope you go -- you know -- I hope you go 
		back to the ranch and the farm is what I'm about to say. I haven't seen 
		it.Question:Mr. President, I have a 
		question about the nuclear weapons the United States is keeping. It's 
		around 3,000 nuclear weapons, so I want to know your opinion when you 
		are going to destroy them?President Bush:Do what, now? 
		I didn't hear what you said.Question:When you are going to --President Bush:I can't hear 
		you very well. I'm sorry, I'm not trying to avoid the question, I just 
		didn't get it.Question:United States has 3,000 
		nuclear weapons.President Bush:Three 
		thousand nuclear weapons.Question:Yes. And I want to know 
		your opinion about these weapons of mass destruction, that when the 
		United States is going to destroy the nuclear weapons to prevail the 
		peace in the world.President Bush:Got it. No, I 
		appreciate it. One of the first things I did as the President was to 
		negotiate a reduction of nuclear -- deployable nuclear weapons with 
		Vladimir Putin. Actually, I think we had 6,000 at the time, and we 
		agreed to reduce our nuclear -- deployable nuclear arsenals to between 
		1,700 and 2,200. And we're in the process of doing that now. And then of 
		course, there will be -- another President can then evaluate where we 
		are. So we're in the process of honoring what's called the Moscow 
		Treaty.A couple of more and then 
		I've got to hop. Yes, ma'am.Question:Mr. President -- [speaking 
		Spanish.] I know that the relationship between United States and 
		Venezuela is no good. That's not my problem. My problem is -- or the 
		question I have for you is what are you doing in the borders? We try to 
		secure the United States for terrorism, I know. So we're trying to 
		secure the borders, but, as well, some of us of who are Hispanics and 
		professional sometimes are denied the opportunity to work and advance in 
		the workplace because we are minorities.What are you going to do as 
		a [inaudible] -- what are you going to do provide the most secure job in 
		which we serve the country, we serve the university? I can't complain in 
		this university, I've been treated like royalty here, but when you work 
		outside the university as a Hispanic, you are not look good enough 
		because they think you come from Mexico.I come from Venezuela, which 
		is a different country, but all of us are Hispanics and all of us 
		embrace ourselves in America because America is -- North America, the 
		United States. In Central and South America, where one continents 
		embrace each other. So what are you going to do to provide opportunities 
		for the Hispanics who come to this country legally, like I did? Or who 
		are illegal here? We should help them to get legal here, not provide 
		directly a green card, but help them to become legal in step-by-step --President Bush:Okay.Question:-- like all of us have 
		done. Thank you.President Bush:Yes, I got 
		the question. Immigration.First of all, bienvenidos. 
		And we have an obligation in this country to enforce our borders. And 
		there's huge pressure on our borders. We've got a long border, 
		obviously, with Mexico, and a long border with Canada. And the biggest, 
		most problematic area right now is the border with Mexico -- California, 
		Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.The issue is not only 
		Mexican citizens who are coming across the border illegally, but it's 
		other citizens who are coming across the border. And our obligation is 
		to use a wise strategy to shut down the trafficking of anything illegal 
		across the border. We're a country of law, and we must enforce the 
		border. And we spend a lot of time in Washington, D.C. analyzing the 
		border issues, and strategizing with Congress about how to do a better 
		job including the following things: One, increasing the number of Border 
		Patrol agents; two, increasing the use of technology on the border, so 
		that you can see people coming through drones, for example, and then be 
		able to rally the Border Patrol to stop people from coming across.Some physical barriers, 
		particularly in urban centers, are now being constructed. Some berms -- 
		there's parts of our border, where, literally, you can just drive across 
		and there's nothing. You know, it's just nothing -- land, and in you 
		come. And it's hard -- the demarcation zone is different, and it makes 
		it hard for people to enforce the border.Secondly, when we detain 
		somebody at the border, we've got to have a rational policy to help back 
		up the people we're paying to enforce the border. And by that I mean if 
		you're somebody from Central America, for example, caught coming into 
		our country that the policy has been to give you a notification to 
		report back to a judge, and they'll hear your case. Well, guess what? A 
		lot of them don't come back. They're here because they're trying to 
		better their lives, and they're going to move into our society as best 
		as they can. And they're not going to return back. So we're ending 
		what's called ""catch and release,"" and we're beginning to provide more 
		detention space for our Border Patrol to be able to say to people -- 
		particularly from Central America and South America -- you've come 
		illegally, we're sending you back home.Thirdly, in terms of 
		workers. We do have H1, H2B visa programs that we're constantly 
		analyzing with the United States Congress. It makes sense that highly 
		skilled workers, for example, be given work permits here in the United 
		States if it helps us meet an economic objective. But I feel strongly 
		that we need to take the worker program a step further, and I'll tell 
		you why. I'm mindful that most people come here to work. There are a lot 
		of people in your state dependent upon people coming here to work.I tell you I used to say 
		that -- when I was governor of Texas, family values didn't stop at the 
		Rio Grande River. And people if they could make 50 cents and had mouths 
		to feed or $5 and had mouths to feed, a lot of people would come to try 
		find that $5 work. And so here's my position, and that is that if there 
		is someone who will do a job an American won't do, then that person 
		ought to be given a temporary worker card to work in the United States 
		for a set period of time.I do not believe that any 
		guest worker program ought to contain amnesty, because I believe that if 
		you granted amnesty to the people here working now that that would cause 
		another 8 million people or so to come here. I do believe, however, it 
		is humane to say to a person, you're doing a job somebody else won't do, 
		here is a temporary card to enable you to do the card [sic].The length of stay here will 
		be dependent upon the actions of the Congress. It's conceivable you 
		could have a three-year period with a renewal period. I've thought a lot 
		about this issue, I just want you to know. And by the way, when you 
		mention guest worker, a lot of people automatically spring to amnesty, 
		all I want to do is grant legal status. That's just not the case. I 
		don't believe we ought to do that. But I do believe we ought to 
		recognize there are people doing work others won't do.And there's a lot of good 
		employers here in Kansas employing these people, and the employers don't 
		know whether or not somebody is here legally or not. Because what's 
		happened is a whole kind of industry has sprung up around people coming 
		here. And it's inhumane. It's inhumane for the people being trafficked 
		into the United States, and it's not fair to employers who may be 
		breaking the law.And here's what I mean -- 
		you've got people being smuggled into the United States of America by 
		these criminal networks. They're called coyotes -- coyotes. And they're 
		bringing them in, in the back of 18-wheelers, stuffing human beings to 
		come and do work in America that Americans won't do -- in the back of 
		18-wheelers. You've got a whole forgery industry up and running, you 
		know? And so these guys show up with documents that -- so the employer 
		says, well, you look legal to me. They don't know whether they're legal 
		or not legal.And I know that we've got a 
		lot of our Border Patrol agents trying to catch people sneaking in the 
		country. And so it seems like to me that why don't we recognize reality, 
		give people workers cards on a temporary basis so somebody can come back 
		and forth legally, with tamper-proof card that will enable an employer 
		to know whether or not they're hiring somebody who is illegal. And if we 
		catch employers after that hiring somebody illegal, there's got to be a 
		fine and a consequence.And so a compassionate way 
		to enforce our border is to give people a temporary worker card without 
		granting amnesty. That's a long answer to a very important problem that 
		is -- now is the time for the United States to take it on squarely, in a 
		humane way, that recognizes the situation and deals with it in an 
		up-front way. And I want to thank you for the question.Look, I've got dinner 
		tonight. I'd like to be here for a longer period of time, but Laura is 
		serving dinner for retiring Alan Greenspan and I better not be late, 
		otherwise all that advice, it will be kind of -- have a little different 
		tone to it. I've really enjoyed being here. I want to thank you for your 
		courtesy for having me. Thank you for supporting a great university in 
		Kansas State University.May God bless you all and 
		may God continue to bless our country.Thank you very much.Text and Image Source:

for pdfMr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of 

Congress, members of the Supreme Court and diplomatic corps, distinguished 

guests, and fellow citizens, today our nation lost a beloved, graceful, 

courageous woman who called America to its founding ideals and carried on a 

noble dream. Tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the 

husband who was taken so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of 

Coretta Scott King.Every time I'm invited 

to this rostrum, I am humbled by the privilege and mindful of the history we 

have seen together. We have gathered under this Capitol dome in moments of 

national mourning and national achievement. We have served America through one 

of the most consequential periods of our history. And it has been my honor to 

serve with you.In a system of two parties, two chambers and two 

elected branches, there will always be differences and debate. But even tough 

debates can be conducted in a civil tone. And our differences cannot be allowed 

to harden into anger. To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a 

spirit of good will and respect for one another. And I will do my part. And I 

will do my part.Tonight the state of our Union is strong, and 

together we will make it stronger. In this decisive year, you and I will make 

choices that determine both the future and the character of our country. We will 

choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom or retreat from our 

duties in the hope of an easier life. We will choose to build our prosperity by 

leading the world economy or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity.In a complex and challenging time, the road of 

isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting, yet it ends in 

danger and decline. The only way to protect our people, the only way to secure 

the peace, the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership. So the 

United States of America will continue to lead.Abroad, our nation is committed to an historic, 

long-term goal: We seek the end of tyranny in our world. Some dismiss that goal 

as misguided idealism. In reality, the future security of America depends on it. 

On September the 11th, 2001, we found that problems originating in a failed and 

oppressive state 7,000 miles away could bring murder and destruction to our 

country. Dictatorships shelter terrorists, and feed resentment and radicalism, 

and seek weapons of mass destruction. Democracies replace resentment with hope, 

respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight 

against terror. Every step toward freedom in the world makes our country safer, 

and so we will act boldly in freedom's cause.Far from being a hopeless dream, the advance of 

freedom is the great story of our time. In 1945, there were about two dozen 

lonely democracies in the world. Today there are 122. And we are writing a new 

chapter in the story of self-government, with women lining up to vote in 

Afghanistan, and millions of Iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink, and 

men and women from Lebanon to Egypt debating the rights of individuals and the 

necessity of freedom.At the start of 2006, more than half the people 

of our world live in democratic nations. And we do not forget the other half -- 

in places like Syria and Burma, Zimbabwe, North Korea and Iran -- because the 

demands of justice and the peace of this world require their freedom as well.No one can deny the success of freedom, but some 

men rage and fight against it. And one of the main sources of reaction and 

opposition is radical Islam; the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an 

ideology of terror and death. Terrorists like bin Laden are serious about mass 

murder and all of us must take their declared intentions seriously. They seek to 

impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the Middle East and 

arm themselves with weapons of mass murder.Their aim is to seize power in Iraq and use it as 

a safe haven to launch attacks against America and the world. Lacking the 

military strength to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the 

weapon of fear. When they murder children at a school in Beslan or blow up 

commuters in London or behead a bound captive, the terrorists hope these horrors 

will break our will, allowing the violent to inherit the Earth. But they have 

miscalculated. We love our freedom, and we will fight to keep it.In a time of testing, we cannot find security by 

abandoning our commitments and retreating within our borders. If we were to 

leave these vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone. They would 

simply move the battlefield to our own shores. There is no peace in retreat. And 

there is no honor in retreat. By allowing radical Islam to work its will, by 

leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself, we would signal to all that we no 

longer believe in our own ideals or even in our own courage.But our enemies and our friends can be certain: 

The United States will not retreat from the world, and we will never surrender 

to evil. America rejects the false comfort of isolationism. We are the nation 

that saved liberty in Europe, and liberated death camps, and helped raise up 

democracies and faced down an evil empire.Once again, we accept the call of history to 

deliver the oppressed and move this world toward peace. We remain on the 

offensive against terror networks. We have killed or captured many of their 

leaders. And, for the others, their day will come. We remain on the offensive in 

Afghanistan, where a fine president and a national assembly are fighting terror 

while building the institutions of a new democracy.We're on the offensive in Iraq, with a clear plan 

for victory. First, we are helping Iraqis build an inclusive government, so that 

old resentments will be eased and the insurgency will be marginalized. Second, 

we are continuing reconstruction efforts and helping the Iraqi government to 

fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all Iraqis can experience the 

benefits of freedom. Third, we are striking terrorist targets while we train 

Iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating the enemy. Iraqis are 

showing their courage every day, and we are proud to be their allies in the 

cause of freedom.Our work in Iraq is difficult, because our enemy 

is brutal. But that brutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new 

democracy. In less than three years, the nation has gone from dictatorship, to 

liberation, to sovereignty, to a constitution, to national elections. At the 

same time, our coalition has been relentless in shutting off terrorist 

infiltration, clearing out insurgent strongholds and turning over territory to 

Iraqi security forces. I am confident in our plan for victory. I am confident in 

the will of the Iraqi people. I am confident in the skill and spirit of our 

military.Fellow citizens, we are in this fight to win, and 

we are winning. The road of victory is the road that will take our troops home. 

As we make progress on the ground and Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead, 

we should be able to further decrease our troop levels. But those decisions will 

be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, D.C. Our 

coalition has learned from our experience in Iraq. We have adjusted our military 

tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction. Along the way, we have 

benefited from responsible criticism and counsel offered by members of Congress 

of both parties.In the coming year, I will continue to reach out 

and seek your good advice. Yet there is a difference between responsible 

criticism that aims for success and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge 

anything but failure. Hindsight alone is not wisdom. And second-guessing is not 

a strategy. With so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a 

duty to speak with candor. A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would 

abandon our Iraqi allies to death and prison, would put men like bin Laden and 

Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country and show that a pledge from America 

means little.Members of Congress, however we feel about the 

decisions and debates of the past, our nation has only one option: We must keep 

our word, defeat our enemies and stand behind the American military in its vital 

mission. Our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices and showing a sense 

of duty stronger than all fear. They know what it's like to fight house to house 

in a maze of streets, to wear heavy gear in the desert heat, to see a comrade 

killed by a roadside bomb.And those who know the costs also know the 

stakes. Marine Staff Sergeant Dan Clay was killed last month fighting in Fabiani. 

He left behind a letter to his family, but his words could just as well be 

addressed to every American. Here is what Dan wrote: ""I know what honor is. It 

has been an honor to protect and serve all of you. I faced death with the secure 

knowledge that you would not have to. ""Never falter. Don't hesitate to honor and 

support those of us who had the honor of protecting that which is worth 

protecting."" Staff Sergeant Dan Clay's wife, Lisa, and his mom and dad, Sara Jo 

and Bud, are with us this evening. Welcome.Our nation is grateful to the fallen who live in 

the memory of our country. We are grateful to all who volunteer to wear our 

nation's uniform. And, as we honor our brave troops, let us never forget the 

sacrifices of America's military families.Our offensive against terror involves more than 

military action. Ultimately, the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat 

their dark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of 

political freedom and peaceful change. So the United States of America supports 

democratic reform across the broader Middle East. Elections are vital, but they 

are only the beginning.Raising up a democracy requires the rule of law, 

and protection of minorities, and strong, accountable institutions that last 

longer than a single vote. The great people of Egypt have voted in a multiparty 

presidential election, and now their government should open paths of peaceful 

opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism. The Palestinian people 

have voted in elections. And now the leaders of Hamas must recognize Israel, 

disarm, reject terrorism and work for lasting peace. Saudi Arabia has taken the 

first steps of reform. Now it can offer its people a better future by pressing 

forward with those efforts.Democracies in the Middle East will not look like 

our own, because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens. Yet 

liberty is the future of every nation in the Middle East, because liberty is the 

right and hope of all humanity. The same is true of Iran, a nation now held 

hostage by a small clerical elite that is isolating and repressing its people. 

The regime in that country sponsors terrorists in the Palestinian territories 

and in Lebanon, and that must come to an end. The Iranian government is defying 

the world with its nuclear ambitions, and the nations of the world must not 

permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons. America will continue to 

rally the world to confront these threats.And, tonight, let me speak directly to the 

citizens of Iran: America respects you and we respect your country. We respect 

your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom. And our nation 

hopes one day to be the closest of friends with a free and democratic Iran.To overcome dangers in our world, we must also 

take the offensive by encouraging economic progress and fighting disease and 

spreading hope in hopeless lands. Isolationism would not only tie our hands in 

fighting enemies; it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need.We show compassion abroad because Americans 

believe in the God- given dignity and worth of a villager with HIV/AIDS, or an 

infant with malaria, or a refugee fleeing genocide, or a young girl sold into 

slavery. We also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by poverty, 

corruption and despair are sources of terrorism and organized crime and human 

trafficking and the drug trade. In recent years, you and I have taken 

unprecedented action to fight AIDS and malaria, expand the education of girls, 

and reward developing nations that are moving forward with economic and 

political reform. For people everywhere, the United States is a partner for a 

better life. Short-changing these efforts would increase the suffering and chaos 

of our world, undercut our long-term security and dull the conscience of our 

country.I urge members of Congress to serve the interests 

of America by showing the compassion of America. Our country must also remain on 

the offensive against terrorism here at home. The enemy has not lost the desire 

or capability to attack us. Fortunately, this nation has superb professionals in 

law enforcement, intelligence, the military and homeland security. These men and 

women are dedicating their lives to protecting us all, and they deserve our 

support and our thanks. They also deserve the same tools they already use to 

fight drug trafficking and organized crime -- so I ask you to reauthorize the 

Patriot Act.It is said that prior to the attacks of September 

the 11th, our government failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy. We now 

know that two of the hijackers in the United States placed telephone calls to Al 

Qaida operatives overseas. But we did not know about their plans until it was 

too late.So to prevent another attack -- based on 

authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute -- I have authorized a 

terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international 

communications of suspected Al Qaida operatives and affiliates to and from 

America. Previous presidents have used the same constitutional authority I have 

and federal courts have approved the use of that authority. Appropriate members 

of Congress have been kept informed.The terrorist surveillance program has helped 

prevent terrorist attacks. It remains essential to the security of America. If 

there are people inside our country who are talking with Al Qaida, we want to 

know about it, because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again. In all 

these areas -- from the disruption of terror networks, to victory in Iraq, to 

the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions -- we need the support of our 

friends and allies.To draw that support, we must always be clear in 

our principles and willing to act. The only alternative to American leadership 

is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world. Yet we also choose to lead 

because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth. American 

leaders -- from Roosevelt, to Truman, to Kennedy, to Reagan -- rejected 

isolation and retreat because they knew that America is always more secure when 

freedom is on the march.Our own generation is in a long war against a 

determined enemy, a war that will be fought by presidents of both parties who 

will need steady bipartisan support from the Congress. And tonight I ask for 

yours. Together, let us protect our country, support the men and women who 

defend us, and lead this world toward freedom.Here at home, America also has a great 

opportunity: We will build the prosperity of our country by strengthening our 

economic leadership in the world. Our economy is healthy and vigorous, and 

growing faster than other major industrialized nations. In the last 

two-and-a-half years, America has created 4.6 million new jobs -- more than 

Japan and the European Union combined. Even in the face of higher energy prices 

and natural disasters, the American people have turned in an economic 

performance that is the envy of the world. The American economy is preeminent, 

but we cannot afford to be complacent. In a dynamic world economy, we are seeing 

new competitors like China and India. And this creates uncertainty, which makes 

it easier to feed people's fears.So we're seeing some old temptations return. 

Protectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we can keep our high 

standard of living while walling off our economy. Others say that the government 

needs to take a larger role in directing the economy, centralizing more power in 

Washington and increasing taxes. We hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad 

for the economy, even though this economy could not function without them. All 

these are forms of economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction: toward 

a stagnant and second-rate economy.Tonight I will set out a better path: an agenda 

for a nation that competes with confidence, an agenda that will raise standards 

of living and generate new jobs. Americans should not fear our economic future, 

because we intend to shape it. Keeping America competitive begins with keeping 

our economy growing. And our economy grows when Americans have more of their own 

money to spend, save and invest.In the last five years, the tax relief you passed 

has left $880 billion in the hands of American workers, investors, small 

businesses and families. And they have used it to help produce more than four 

years of uninterrupted economic growth. Yet the tax relief is set to expire in 

the next few years. If we do nothing, American families will face a massive tax 

increase they do not expect and will not welcome. Because America needs more 

than a temporary expansion, we need more than temporary tax relief. I urge the 

Congress to act responsibly and make the tax cuts permanent.Keeping America competitive requires us to be 

good stewards of tax dollars. Every year of my presidency, we've reduced the 

growth of nonsecurity discretionary spending. And last year you passed bills 

that cut this spending. This year my budget will cut it again and reduce or 

eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling 

essential priorities. By passing these reforms, we will save the American 

taxpayer another $14 billion next year and stay on track to cut the deficit in 

half by 2009.I am pleased that the members of Congress are 

working on earmark reform, because the federal budget has too many special 

interest projects. And we can tackle this problem together, if you pass the 

line-item veto.We must also confront the larger challenge of 

mandatory spending, or entitlements. This year, the first of about 78 million 

baby boomers turns 60, including two of my dad's favorite people: me and 

President Clinton. This milestone is more than a personal crisis. It is a 

national challenge.The retirement of the baby boom generation will 

put unprecedented strains on the federal government. By 2030, spending for 

Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of the 

entire federal budget. And that will present future Congresses with impossible 

choices: staggering tax increases, immense deficits or deep cuts in every 

category of spending. Congress did not act last year on my proposal to save 

Social Security, yet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not 

going away. And with every year we fail to act, the situation gets worse.So tonight I ask you to join me in creating a 

commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements on Social 

Security, Medicare and Medicaid. This commission should include members of 

Congress of both parties and offer bipartisan solutions. We need to put aside 

partisan politics and work together and get this problem solved.Keeping America competitive requires us to open 

more markets for all that Americans make and grow. One out of every five factory 

jobs in America is related to global trade, and we want people everywhere to buy 

American. With open markets and a level playing field, no one can out- produce 

or out-compete the American worker.Keeping America competitive requires an 

immigration system that upholds our laws, reflects our values and serves the 

interests of our economy. Our nation needs orderly and secure borders. To meet 

this goal, we must have stronger immigration enforcement and border protection. 

And we must have a rational, humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty, 

allows temporary jobs for people who seek them legally, and reduces smuggling 

and crime at the border.Keeping America competitive requires affordable 

health care. Our government has a responsibility to help provide health care for 

the poor and the elderly, and we are meeting that responsibility. For all 

Americans -- for all Americans -- we must confront the rising cost of care, 

strengthen the doctor-patient relationship, and help people afford the insurance 

coverage they need. We will make wider use of electronic records and other 

health information technology to help control costs and reduce dangerous medical 

errors. We will strengthen health savings accounts, making sure individuals and 

small-business employees can buy insurance with the same advantages that people 

working for big businesses now get. We will do more to make this coverage 

portable, so workers can switch jobs without having to worry about losing their 

health insurance. And because lawsuits are driving many good doctors out of 

practice -- leaving women in nearly 1,500 American counties without a single OB/GYN 

-- I ask the Congress to pass medical liability reform this year.Keeping America competitive requires affordable 

energy. And here we have a serious problem: America is addicted to oil, which is 

often imported from unstable parts of the world. The best way to break this 

addiction is through technology. Since 2001, we have spent nearly $10 billion to 

develop cleaner, cheaper and more reliable alternative energy sources. And we 

are on the threshold of incredible advances.So tonight I announce the Advanced Energy 

Initiative -- a 22 percent increase in clean-energy research at the Department 

of Energy to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas. To change how we power 

our homes and offices, we will invest more in zero-emission coal-fired plants; 

revolutionary solar and wind technologies; and clean, safe nuclear energy. We 

must also change how we power our automobiles. We will increase our research in 

better batteries for hybrid and electric cars and in pollution-free cars that 

run on hydrogen.We will also fund additional research in 

cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol, not just from corn but from wood 

chips and stalks or switch grass. Our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol 

practical and competitive within six years. Breakthroughs on this and other new 

technologies will help us reach another great goal: to replace more than 75 

percent of our oil imports from the Middle East by 2025. By applying -- By 

applying the talent and technology of America, this country can dramatically 

improve our environment, move beyond a petroleum- based economy and make our 

dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past.And to keep America competitive, one commitment 

is necessary above all: We must continue to lead the world in human talent and 

creativity. Our greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated, 

hardworking, ambitious people, and we are going to keep that edge. Tonight I 

announce the American Competitiveness Initiative to encourage innovation 

throughout our economy and to give our nation's children a firm grounding in 

math and science.First, I propose to double the federal commitment 

to the most critical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the 

next 10 years. This funding will support the work of America's most creative 

minds as they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology, supercomputing and 

alternative energy sources.Second, I propose to make permanent the research 

and development tax credit, to encourage bolder private-sector initiatives in 

technology. With more research in both the public and private sectors, we will 

improve our quality of life and ensure that America will lead the world in 

opportunity and innovation for decades to come.Third, we need to encourage children to take more 

math and science, and to make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete 

with other nations. We made a good start in the early grades with the No Child 

Left Behind Act, which is raising standards and lifting test scores across our 

country.Tonight I propose to train 70,000 high school 

teachers to lead advanced placement courses in math and science, bring 30,000 

math and science professionals to teach in classrooms, and give early help to 

students who struggle with math so they have a better chance at good, high-wage 

jobs. If we ensure that America's children succeed in life, they will ensure 

that America succeeds in the world. Preparing our nation to compete in the world 

is a goal that all of us can share. I urge you to support the American 

Competitiveness Initiative and, together, we will show the world what the 

American people can achieve.America is a great force for freedom and 

prosperity. Yet our greatness is not measured in power or luxuries, but by who 

we are and how we treat one another. So we strive to be a compassionate, decent, 

hopeful society. In recent years, America has become a more hopeful nation. 

Violent crime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s. Welfare 

cases have dropped by more than half over the past decade. Drug use among youth 

is down 19 percent since 2001. There are fewer abortions in America than at any 

point in the last three decades. And the number of children born to teenage 

mothers has been falling for a dozen years in a row. These gains are evidence of 

a quiet transformation, a revolution of conscience in which a rising generation 

is finding that a life of personal responsibility is a life of fulfillment.Government has played a role. Wise policies such 

as welfare reform, and drug education, and support for abstinence and adoption 

have made a difference in the character of our country. And everyone here 

tonight, Democrat and Republican, has a right to be proud of this record.Yet many Americans, especially parents, still 

have deep concerns about the direction of our culture and the health of our most 

basic institutions. They are concerned about unethical conduct by public 

officials and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine marriage. They 

worry about children in our society who need direction and love, and about 

fellow citizens still displaced by natural disaster, and about suffering caused 

by treatable diseases. As we look at these challenges, we must never give in to 

the belief that America is in decline or that our culture is doomed to unravel. 

The American people know better than that. We have proven the pessimists wrong 

before, and we will do it again.A hopeful society depends on courts that deliver 

equal justice under law. The Supreme Court now has two superb new members -- new 

members on its bench: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sam Alito. I thank 

the Senate for confirming both of them. I will continue to nominate men and 

women who understand that judges must be servants of the law and not legislate 

from the bench.Today marks the official retirement of a very 

special American. For 24 years of faithful service to our nation, the United 

States is grateful to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.A hopeful society has institutions of science and 

medicine that do not cut ethical corners and that recognize the matchless value 

of every life. Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most 

egregious abuses of medical research: human cloning in all its forms; creating 

or implanting embryos for experiments; creating human-animal hybrids; and 

buying, selling or patenting human embryos. Human life is a gift from our 

creator, and that gift should never be discarded, devalued or put up for sale.A hopeful society expects elected officials to 

uphold the public trust. Honorable people in both parties are working on reforms 

to strengthen the ethical standards of Washington. I support your efforts. Each 

of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility, and that is a 

pledge we must never forget, never dismiss and never betray.As we renew the promise of our institutions, let 

us also show the character of America in our compassion and care for one 

another. As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the 

character of America in our compassion and care for one another.A hopeful society gives special attention to 

children who lack direction and love. Through the Helping America's Youth 

Initiative, we are encouraging caring adults to get involved in the life of a 

child. And this good work is led by our first lady, Laura Bush. This year we 

will add resources to encourage young people to stay in school so more of 

America's youth can raise their sights and achieve their dreams.A hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow 

citizens in times of suffering and emergency and stays at it until they're back 

on their feet. So far, the federal government has committed $85 billion to the 

people of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans. We are removing debris and repairing 

highways and rebuilding stronger levees. We're providing business loans and 

housing assistance.Yet, as we meet these immediate needs, we must 

also address deeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived. In New 

Orleans and in other places, many of our fellow citizens have felt excluded from 

the promise of our country. The answer is not only temporary relief, but schools 

that teach every child, and job skills that bring upward mobility, and more 

opportunities to own a home and start a business. As we recover from a disaster, 

let us also work for the day when all Americans are protected by justice; equal 

in hope and rich in opportunity.A hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases 

like HIV/AIDS, which can be prevented and treated and defeated. More than a 

million Americans live with HIV, and half of all AIDS cases occur among 

African-Americans. I ask Congress to reform and reauthorize the Ryan White Act 

and provide new funding to states so we end the waiting lists for AIDS medicines 

in America. We will also lead a nationwide effort, working closely with 

African-American churches and faith-based groups, to deliver rapid HIV tests to 

millions, end the stigma of AIDS and come closer to the day when there are no 

new infections in America.Fellow citizens, we have been called to 

leadership in a period of consequence. We have entered a great ideological 

conflict we did nothing to invite. We see great changes in science and commerce 

that will influence all our lives. Sometimes it can seem that history is turning 

in a wide arc, toward an unknown shore. Yet the destination of history is 

determined by human action, and every great movement of history comes to a point 

of choosing.Lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of 

disunity and continued slavery. Martin Luther King could have stopped at 

Birmingham or at Selma and achieved only half a victory over segregation. The 

United States could have accepted the permanent division of Europe and been 

complicit in the oppression of others.Today, having come far in our own historical 

journey, we must decide: Will we turn back or finish well? Before history is 

written down in books, it is written in courage. Like Americans before us, we 

will show that courage and we will finish well. We will lead freedom's advance. 

We will compete and excel in the global economy. We will renew the defining 

moral commitments of this land. And so we move forward optimistic about our 

country, faithful to its cause and confident of the victories to come.May God bless America.Also in this database:2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2007,20082009,20102011201220132014201520162017State of the Union AddressesText, Audio, Video, Images Source:

for pdfGood evening. 
			I've asked for a few minutes of your time to discuss a matter of 
			national importance -- the reform of America's immigration system.The issue of 
			immigration stirs intense emotions, and in recent weeks, Americans 
			have seen those emotions on display. On the streets of major cities, 
			crowds have rallied in support of those in our country illegally. At 
			our southern border, others have organized to stop illegal 
			immigrants from coming in. Across the country, Americans are trying 
			to reconcile these contrasting images. And in Washington, the debate 
			over immigration reform has reached a time of decision. Tonight, I 
			will make it clear where I stand, and where I want to lead our 
			country on this vital issue.We must begin 
			by recognizing the problems with our immigration system. For 
			decades, the United States has not been in complete control of its 
			borders. As a result, many who want to work in our economy have been 
			able to sneak across our border, and millions have stayed.Once here, 
			illegal immigrants live in the shadows of our society. Many use 
			forged documents to get jobs, and that makes it difficult for 
			employers to verify that the workers they hire are legal. Illegal 
			immigration puts pressure on public schools and hospitals, it 
			strains state and local budgets, and brings crime to our 
			communities. These are real problems. Yet we must remember that the 
			vast majority of illegal immigrants are decent people who work hard, 
			support their families, practice their faith, and lead responsible 
			lives. They are a part of American life, but they are beyond the 
			reach and protection of American law.We're a nation 
			of laws, and we must enforce our laws. We're also a nation of 
			immigrants, and we must uphold that tradition, which has 
			strengthened our country in so many ways. These are not 
			contradictory goals. America can be a lawful society and a welcoming 
			society at the same time. We will fix the problems created by 
			illegal immigration, and we will deliver a system that is secure, 
			orderly, and fair. So I support comprehensive immigration reform 
			that will accomplish five clear objectives.First, the 
			United States must secure its borders. This is a basic 
			responsibility of a sovereign nation. It is also an urgent 
			requirement of our national security. Our objective is 
			straightforward: The border should be open to trade and lawful 
			immigration, and shut to illegal immigrants, as well as criminals, 
			drug dealers, and terrorists.I was a 
			governor of a state that has a 1,200-mile border with Mexico. So I 
			know how difficult it is to enforce the border, and how important it 
			is. Since I became President, we've increased funding for border 
			security by 66 percent, and expanded the Border Patrol from about 
			9,000 to 12,000 agents. The men and women of our Border Patrol are 
			doing a fine job in difficult circumstances, and over the past five 
			years, they have apprehended and sent home about six million people 
			entering America illegally.Despite this 
			progress, we do not yet have full control of the border, and I am 
			determined to change that. Tonight I'm calling on Congress to 
			provide funding for dramatic improvements in manpower and technology 
			at the border. By the end of 2008, we'll increase the number of 
			Border Patrol officers by an additional 6,000. When these new agents 
			are deployed, we'll have more than doubled the size of the Border 
			Patrol during my presidency.At the same 
			time, we're launching the most technologically advanced border 
			security initiative in American history. We will construct high-tech 
			fences in urban corridors, and build new patrol roads and barriers 
			in rural areas. We'll employ motion sensors, infrared cameras, and 
			unmanned aerial vehicles to prevent illegal crossings. America has 
			the best technology in the world, and we will ensure that the Border 
			Patrol has the technology they need to do their job and secure our 
			border.Training 
			thousands of new Border Patrol agents and bringing the most advanced 
			technology to the border will take time. Yet the need to secure our 
			border is urgent. So I'm announcing several immediate steps to 
			strengthen border enforcement during this period of transition:One way to 
			help during this transition is to use the National Guard. So, in 
			coordination with governors, up to 6,000 Guard members will be 
			deployed to our southern border. The Border Patrol will remain in 
			the lead. The Guard will assist the Border Patrol by operating 
			surveillance systems, analyzing intelligence, installing fences and 
			vehicle barriers, building patrol roads, and providing training. 
			Guard units will not be involved in direct law enforcement 
			activities -- that duty will be done by the Border Patrol. This 
			initial commitment of Guard members would last for a period of one 
			year. After that, the number of Guard forces will be reduced as new 
			Border Patrol agents and new technologies come online. It is 
			important for Americans to know that we have enough Guard forces to 
			win the war on terror, to respond to natural disasters, and to help 
			secure our border.The United 
			States is not going to militarize the southern border. Mexico is our 
			neighbor, and our friend. We will continue to work cooperatively to 
			improve security on both sides of the border, to confront common 
			problems like drug trafficking and crime, and to reduce illegal 
			immigration.Another way to 
			help during this period of transition is through state and local law 
			enforcement in our border communities. So we'll increase federal 
			funding for state and local authorities assisting the Border Patrol 
			on targeted enforcement missions. We will give state and local 
			authorities the specialized training they need to help federal 
			officers apprehend and detain illegal immigrants. State and local 
			law enforcement officials are an important part of our border 
			security and they need to be a part of our strategy to secure our 
			borders.The steps I've 
			outlined will improve our ability to catch people entering our 
			country illegally. At the same time, we must ensure that every 
			illegal immigrant we catch crossing our southern border is returned 
			home. More than 85 percent of the illegal immigrants we catch 
			crossing the southern border are Mexicans, and most are sent back 
			home within 24 hours. But when we catch illegal immigrants from 
			other country [sic] it is not as easy to send them home. For many 
			years, the government did not have enough space in our detention 
			facilities to hold them while the legal process unfolded. So most 
			were released back into our society and asked to return for a court 
			date. When the date arrived, the vast majority did not show up. This 
			practice, called ""catch and release,"" is unacceptable, and we will 
			end it.We're taking 
			several important steps to meet this goal. We've expanded the number 
			of beds in our detention facilities, and we will continue to add 
			more. We've expedited the legal process to cut the average 
			deportation time. And we're making it clear to foreign governments 
			that they must accept back their citizens who violate our 
			immigration laws. As a result of these actions, we've ended ""catch 
			and release"" for illegal immigrants from some countries. And I will 
			ask Congress for additional funding and legal authority, so we can 
			end ""catch and release"" at the southern border once and for all. 
			When people know that they'll be caught and sent home if they enter 
			our country illegally, they will be less likely to try to sneak in.Second, to 
			secure our border, we must create a temporary worker program. The 
			reality is that there are many people on the other side of our 
			border who will do anything to come to America to work and build a 
			better life. They walk across miles of desert in the summer heat, or 
			hide in the back of 18-wheelers to reach our country. This creates 
			enormous pressure on our border that walls and patrols alone will 
			not stop. To secure the border effectively, we must reduce the 
			numbers of people trying to sneak across.Therefore, I 
			support a temporary worker program that would create a legal path 
			for foreign workers to enter our country in an orderly way, for a 
			limited period of time. This program would match willing foreign 
			workers with willing American employers for jobs Americans are not 
			doing. Every worker who applies for the program would be required to 
			pass criminal background checks. And temporary workers must return 
			to their home country at the conclusion of their stay.A temporary 
			worker program would meet the needs of our economy, and it would 
			give honest immigrants a way to provide for their families while 
			respecting the law. A temporary worker program would reduce the 
			appeal of human smugglers, and make it less likely that people would 
			risk their lives to cross the border. It would ease the financial 
			burden on state and local governments, by replacing illegal workers 
			with lawful taxpayers. And above all, a temporary worker program 
			would add to our security by making certain we know who is in our 
			country and why they are here.Third, we need 
			to hold employers to account for the workers they hire. It is 
			against the law to hire someone who is in this country illegally. 
			Yet businesses often cannot verify the legal status of their 
			employees because of the widespread problem of document fraud. 
			Therefore, comprehensive immigration reform must include a better 
			system for verifying documents and work eligibility. A key part of 
			that system should be a new identification card for every legal 
			foreign worker. This card should use biometric technology, such as 
			digital fingerprints, to make it tamper-proof. A tamper-proof card 
			would help us enforce the law, and leave employers with no excuse 
			for violating it. And by making it harder for illegal immigrants to 
			find work in our country, we would discourage people from crossing 
			the border illegally in the first place.Fourth, we 
			must face the reality that millions of illegal immigrants are here 
			already. They should not be given an automatic path to citizenship. 
			This is amnesty, and I oppose it. Amnesty would be unfair to those 
			who are here lawfully, and it would invite further waves of illegal 
			immigration.Some in this 
			country argue that the solution is to deport every illegal 
			immigrant, and that any proposal short of this amounts to amnesty. I 
			disagree. It is neither wise, nor realistic to round up millions of 
			people, many with deep roots in the United States, and send them 
			across the border. There is a rational middle ground between 
			granting an automatic path to citizenship for every illegal 
			immigrant, and a program of mass deportation. That middle ground 
			recognizes there are differences between an illegal immigrant who 
			crossed the border recently, and someone who has worked here for 
			many years, and has a home, a family, and an otherwise clean record.I believe that 
			illegal immigrants who have roots in our country and want to stay 
			should have to pay a meaningful penalty for breaking the law, to pay 
			their taxes, to learn English, and to work in a job for a number of 
			years. People who meet these conditions should be able to apply for 
			citizenship, but approval would not be automatic, and they will have 
			to wait in line behind those who played by the rules and followed 
			the law. What I've just described is not amnesty, it is a way for 
			those who have broken the law to pay their debt to society, and 
			demonstrate the character that makes a good citizen.Fifth, we must 
			honor the great American tradition of the melting pot, which has 
			made us one nation out of many peoples. The success of our country 
			depends upon helping newcomers assimilate into our society, and 
			embrace our common identity as Americans. Americans are bound 
			together by our shared ideals, an appreciation of our history, 
			respect for the flag we fly, and an ability to speak and write the 
			English language. English is also the key to unlocking the 
			opportunity of America. English allows newcomers to go from picking 
			crops to opening a grocery, from cleaning offices to running 
			offices, from a life of low-paying jobs to a diploma, a career, and 
			a home of their own. When immigrants assimilate and advance in our 
			society, they realize their dreams, they renew our spirit, and they 
			add to the unity of America.Tonight, I 
			want to speak directly to members of the House and the Senate: An 
			immigration reform bill needs to be comprehensive, because all 
			elements of this problem must be addressed together, or none of them 
			will be solved at all. The House has passed an immigration bill. The 
			Senate should act by the end of this month so we can work out the 
			differences between the two bills, and Congress can pass a 
			comprehensive bill for me to sign into law.America needs 
			to conduct this debate on immigration in a reasoned and respectful 
			tone. Feelings run deep on this issue, and as we work it out, all of 
			us need to keep some things in mind. We cannot build a unified 
			country by inciting people to anger, or playing on anyone's fears, 
			or exploiting the issue of immigration for political gain. We must 
			always remember that real lives will be affected by our debates and 
			decisions, and that every human being has dignity and value no 
			matter what their citizenship papers say.I know many of 
			you listening tonight have a parent or a grandparent who came here 
			from another country with dreams of a better life. You know what 
			freedom meant to them, and you know that America is a more hopeful 
			country because of their hard work and sacrifice. As President, I've 
			had the opportunity to meet people of many backgrounds, and hear 
			what America means to them. On a visit to Bethesda Naval Hospital, 
			Laura and I met a wounded Marine named Guadalupe Denogean. Master 
			Gunnery Sergeant Denogean came to the United States from Mexico when 
			he was a boy. He spent his summers picking crops with his family, 
			and then he volunteered for the United States Marine Corps as soon 
			as he was able. During the liberation of Iraq, Master Gunnery 
			Sergeant Denogean was seriously injured. And when asked if he had 
			any requests, he made two: a promotion for the corporal who helped 
			rescue him, and the chance to become an American citizen. And when 
			this brave Marine raised his right hand, and swore an oath to become 
			a citizen of the country he had defended for more than 26 years, I 
			was honored to stand at his side.We will always 
			be proud to welcome people like Guadalupe Denogean as fellow 
			Americans. Our new immigrants are just what they've always been -- 
			people willing to risk everything for the dream of freedom. And 
			America remains what she has always been: the great hope on the 
			horizon, an open door to the future, a blessed and promised land. We 
			honor the heritage of all who come here, no matter where they come 
			from, because we trust in our country's genius for making us all 
			Americans -- one nation under God.Thank you, and

67,10 January 2008,>George W. Bush - Address to the Military Officers Association of Ameri,"Thank you all very much.  Thank you all. 
		Please be seated. General Hendrix, thank you for the invitation to be 
		here. Thanks for the kind introduction. I'm honored to stand with the 
		men and women of theMilitary Officers Association of America. I 
		appreciate the Board of Directors who are here, and the leaders who have 
		given me this platform from which to speak. I'm proud to be here with 
		active members of the United States military. Thank you for your 
		service. I'm proud to be your Commander-in-Chief.I 
		am pleased also to stand with members of the diplomatic corps, including 
		many representing nations that have been attacked by al Qaeda and its 
		terrorist allies sinceSeptember the 11th, 2001.  Your presence 
		here reminds us that we're engaged in a global war against an enemy that 
		threatens all civilized nations. And today the civilized world stands 
		together to defend our freedom; we stand together to defeat the 
		terrorists; and were working to secure the peace for generations to 
		come.I appreciate my Attorney General joining us today, 
		Al Gonzales. Thank you for being here.  The Secretary of Homeland 
		Security, Michael Chertoff, is with us.  Three members of the 
		United States Senate -- I might say, three important members of the 
		United States Senate -- Senate President Pro Tem Ted Stevens of Alaska. 
		Thank you for joining us, Senator.  Chairman of the Appropriations 
		Committee, Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi.  The Chairman of 
		the Armed Services Committee, John Warner of Virginia.I thank Norb Ryan, as well, for his leadership. I 
		do appreciate all the folks that are at Walter Reed who have joined us 
		today. I'm going to tell the parents of our troops, we provide great 
		health care to those who wear the uniform. I'm proud of those folks at 
		Bethesda and Walter Reed -- are providing you the best possible care to 
		help you recover from your injuries. Thank you for your courage. Thank 
		you for joining us here today. May God bless you in your recovery.Next week, America will mark the fifth anniversary 
		of September the 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks. As this day approaches, 
		it brings with it a flood of painful memories. We remember the horror of 
		watching planes fly into the World Trade Center, and seeing the towers 
		collapse before our eyes. We remember the sight of the Pentagon, broken 
		and in flames. We remember the rescue workers who rushed into burning 
		buildings to save lives, knowing they might never emerge again. We 
		remember the brave passengers who charged the cockpit of their hijacked 
		plane, and stopped the terrorists from reaching their target and killing 
		more innocent civilians. We remember the cold brutality of the enemy who 
		inflicted this harm on our country -- an enemy whose leader, Osama bin 
		Laden, declared the massacre of nearly 3,000 people that day -- I quote 
		-- ""an unparalleled and magnificent feat of valor, unmatched by any in 
		humankind before them.""In five years since our nation was attacked, al 
		Qaeda and terrorists it has inspired have continued to attack across the 
		world. They've killed the innocent in Europe and Africa and the Middle 
		East, in Central Asia and the Far East, and beyond. Most recently, they 
		attempted to strike again in the most ambitious plot since the attacks 
		of September the 11th -- a plan to blow up passenger planes headed for 
		America over the Atlantic Ocean.Five years after our nation was attacked, the 
		terrorist danger remains. We're a nation at war -- and America and her 
		allies are fighting this war with relentless determination across the 
		world. Together with our coalition partners, we've removed terrorist 
		sanctuaries, disrupted their finances, killed and captured key 
		operatives, broken up terrorist cells in America and other nations, and 
		stopped new attacks before they're carried out. We're on the offense 
		against the terrorists on every battlefront -- and we'll accept nothing 
		less than complete victory.In the five years since our nation was attacked, 
		we've also learned a great deal about the enemy we face in this war. 
		We've learned about them through videos and audio recordings, and 
		letters and statements they've posted on websites. We've learned about 
		them from captured enemy documents that the terrorists have never meant 
		for us to see. Together, these documents and statements have given us 
		clear insight into the mind of our enemies -- their ideology, their 
		ambitions, and their strategy to defeat us.We know what the terrorists intend to do because 
		they've told us -- and we need to take their words seriously. So today 
		I'm going to describe -- in the terrorists' own words, what they 
		believe... what they hope to accomplish, and how they intend to accomplish 
		it. I'll discuss how the enemy has adapted in the wake of our sustained 
		offensive against them, and the threat posed by different strains of 
		violent Islamic radicalism. I'll explain the strategy we're pursuing to 
		protect America, by defeating the terrorists on the battlefield, and 
		defeating their hateful ideology in the battle of ideas.The terrorists who attacked us on September the 
		11th, 2001, are men without conscience -- but they're not madmen. They 
		kill in the name of a clear and focused ideology, a set of beliefs that 
		are evil, but not insane. These al Qaeda terrorists and those who share 
		their ideology are violent Sunni extremists. They're driven by a radical 
		and perverted vision of Islam that rejects tolerance, crushes all 
		dissent, and justifies the murder of innocent men, women and children in 
		the pursuit of political power. They hope to establish a violent 
		political utopia across the Middle East, which they call a ""Caliphate"" 
		-- where all would be ruled according to their hateful ideology. Osama 
		bin Laden has called the 9/11 attacks -- in his words -- ""a great step 
		towards the unity of Muslims and establishing the Righteous... 
		[Caliphate].""This caliphate would be a totalitarian Islamic 
		empire encompassing all current and former Muslim lands, stretching from 
		Europe to North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. We know 
		this because al Qaeda has told us. About two months ago, the terroristZawahiri-- he's al Qaeda's second in command -- declared that al Qaeda 
		intends to impose its rule in ""every land that was a home for Islam, 
		from [Spain] to Iraq. He went on to say, ""The whole world is an open 
		field for us.""We know what this radical empire would look like in 
		practice, because we saw how the radicals imposed their ideology on the 
		people of Afghanistan. Under the rule of the Taliban and al Qaeda, 
		Afghanistan was a totalitarian nightmare -- a land where women were 
		imprisoned in their homes, men were beaten for missing prayer meetings, 
		girls could not go to school, and children were forbidden the smallest 
		pleasures like flying kites. Religious police roamed the streets, 
		beating and detaining civilians for perceived offenses. Women were 
		publicly whipped. Summary executions were held in Kabul's soccer stadium 
		in front of cheering mobs. And Afghanistan was turned into a launching 
		pad for horrific attacks against America and other parts of the 
		civilized world -- including many Muslim nations.The goal of these Sunni extremists is to remake the 
		entire Muslim world in their radical image. In pursuit of their imperial 
		aims, these extremists say there can be no compromise or dialogue with 
		those they call ""infidels"" -- a category that includes America, the 
		world's free nations, Jews, and all Muslims who reject their extreme 
		vision of Islam. They reject the possibility of peaceful coexistence 
		with the free world. Again, hear the words of Osama bin Laden earlier 
		this year: ""Death is better than living on this Earth with the 
		unbelievers among us.""These radicals have declared their uncompromising 
		hostility to freedom. It is foolish to think that you can negotiate with 
		them.  We see the uncompromising nature of the enemy in many 
		captured terrorist documents. Here are just two examples: After the 
		liberation of Afghanistan, coalition forces searching through a 
		terrorist safe house in that country found a copy of the al Qaeda 
		charter. This charter states that ""there will be continuing enmity until 
		everyone believes in Allah. We will not meet [the enemy] halfway. There 
		will be no room for dialogue with them."" Another document was found in 
		2000 by British police during an anti-terrorist raid in London -- a 
		grisly al Qaeda manual that includes chapters with titles such as 
		""Guidelines for Beating and Killing Hostages."" This manual declares that 
		their vision of Islam ""does not...make a truce with unbelief, but rather 
		confronts it."" The confrontation...calls for...the dialogue of bullets, 
		the ideals of assassination, bombing, and destruction, and the diplomacy 
		of the cannon and machine gun.""Still other captured documents show al Qaeda's 
		strategy for infiltrating Muslim nations, establishing terrorist 
		enclaves, overthrowing governments, and building their totalitarian 
		empire. We see this strategy laid out in a captured al Qaeda document 
		found during a recent raid in Iraq, which describes their plans to 
		infiltrate and take over Iraq's western Anbar Province. The document 
		lays out an elaborate al Qaeda governing structure for the region that 
		includes an Education Department, a Social Services Department, a 
		Justice Department, and an ""Execution Unit"" responsible for ""Sorting 
		out, Arrest, Murder, and Destruction.""According to their public statements, countries 
		that have -- they have targeted stretch from the Middle East to Africa, 
		to Southeast Asia. Through this strategy, al Qaeda and its allies intend 
		to create numerous, decentralized operating bases across the world, from 
		which they can plan new attacks, and advance their vision of a unified, 
		totalitarian Islamic state that can confront and eventually destroy the 
		free world.These violent extremists know that to realize this 
		vision, they must first drive out the main obstacle that stands in their 
		way -- the United States of America. According to al Qaeda, their 
		strategy to defeat America has two parts: First, they're waging a 
		campaign of terror across the world. They're targeting our forces 
		abroad, hoping that the American people will grow tired of casualties 
		and give up the fight. And they're targeting America's financial centers 
		and economic infrastructure at home, hoping to terrorize us and cause 
		our economy to collapse.Bin Laden calls this his ""bleed-until-bankruptcy 
		plan."" And he cited the attacks of 9/11 as evidence that such a plan can 
		succeed. With the 9/11 attacks, Osama bin Laden says, ""al Qaeda spent 
		500,000 dollars on the event, while America... lost -- according to the lowest 
		estimate -- 500 billion dollars...meaning that every dollar of al Qaeda defeated 
		a million dollars of America. Bin Laden concludes from this experience 
		that ""America is definitely a great power, with... unbelievable military 
		strength and a vibrant economy, but all of these have been built on a 
		very weak and hollow foundation."" He went on to say, ""Therefore, it is 
		very easy to target the flimsy base and concentrate on their weak 
		points, and even if we're able to target one-tenth of these weak points, 
		we will be able [to] crush and destroy them.""Secondly, along with this campaign of terror, the 
		enemy has a propaganda strategy. Osama bin Laden laid out this strategy 
		in a letter to the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, that coalition forces 
		uncovered in Afghanistan in 2002. In it, bin Laden says that al Qaeda 
		intends to ""[launch],"" in his words, ""a media campaign... to create a 
		wedge between the American people and their government."" This media 
		campaign, bin Laden says, will send the American people a number of 
		messages, including ""that their government [will] bring them more 
		losses, in finances and casualties."" And he goes on to say that ""they 
		are being sacrificed...to serve...the big investors, especially the Jews."" 
		Bin Laden says that by delivering these messages, al Qaeda ""aims at 
		creating pressure from the American people on the American government to 
		stop their campaign against Afghanistan.""Bin Laden and his allies are absolutely convinced 
		they can succeed in forcing America to retreat and causing our economic 
		collapse. They believe our nation is weak and decadent, and lacking in 
		patience and resolve. And they're wrong.  Osama bin Laden has 
		written that the ""defeat of... American forces in Beirut"" in 1983 is 
		proof America does not have the stomach to stay in the fight. He's 
		declared that ""in Somalia...the United States [pulled] out, trailing 
		disappointment, defeat, and failure behind it."" And last year, the 
		terrorist Zawahiri declared that Americans ""know better than others that 
		there is no hope in victory. The Vietnam specter is closing every 
		outlet.""These terrorists hope to drive America and our 
		coalition out of Afghanistan, so they can restore the safe haven they 
		lost when coalition forces drove them out five years ago. But they've 
		made clear that the most important front in their struggle against 
		America is Iraq -- the nation bin Laden has declared the ""capital of the 
		Caliphate."" Hear the words of bin Laden: ""I now address...the whole...Islamic nation: Listen and understand...The most...serious issue today for 
		the whole world is this Third World War...[that] is raging in [Iraq]."" He 
		calls it ""a war of destiny between infidelity and Islam."" He says, ""The 
		whole world is watching this war,"" and that it will end in ""victory and 
		glory or misery and humiliation."" For al Qaeda, Iraq is not a 
		distraction from their war on America -- it is the central battlefield 
		where the outcome of this struggle will be decided.Here is what al Qaeda says they will do if they 
		succeed in driving us out of Iraq: The terrorist Zawahiri has said that 
		al Qaeda will proceed with ""several incremental goals. The first stage: 
		Expel the Americans from Iraq. The second stage: Establish an Islamic 
		authority or amirate, then develop it and support it until it achieves 
		the level of Caliphate... The third stage: Extend the jihad wave to the 
		secular countries neighboring Iraq. And the fourth stage: ...the clash 
		with Israel.""These evil men know that a fundamental threat to 
		their aspirations is a democratic Iraq that can govern itself, sustain 
		itself, and defend itself. They know that given a choice, the Iraqi 
		people will never choose to live in the totalitarian state the 
		extremists hope to establish. And that is why we must not, and we will 
		not, give the enemy victory in Iraq by deserting the Iraqi people.Last year, the terrorist Zarqawi declared in a 
		message posted on the Internet that democracy ""is the essence of 
		infidelity and deviation from the right path."" The Iraqi people 
		disagree. Last December, nearly 12 million Iraqis from every ethnic and 
		religious community turned out to vote in their country's third free 
		election in less than a year. Iraq now has a unity government that 
		represents Iraq's diverse population -- and al Qaeda's top commander in 
		Iraq breathed his last breath.Despite these strategic setbacks, the enemy will 
		continue to fight freedom's advance in Iraq, because they understand the 
		stakes in this war. Again, hear the words of bin Laden, in a message to 
		the American people earlier this year. He says: ""The war is for you or 
		for us to win. If we win it, it means your defeat and disgrace forever.""Now, I know some of our country hear the 
		terrorists' words, and hope that they will not, or cannot, do what they 
		say. History teaches that underestimating the words of evil and 
		ambitious men is a terrible mistake. In the early 1900s, an exiled 
		lawyer in Europe published a pamphlet called ""What Is To Be Done?"" -- in 
		which he laid out his plan to launch a communist revolution in Russia. 
		The world did not heed Lenin's words, and paid a terrible price. The 
		Soviet Empire he established killed tens of millions, and brought the 
		world to the brink of thermonuclear war. In the 1920s, a failed Austrian 
		painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an 
		Aryan super-state in Germany and take revenge on Europe and eradicate 
		the Jews. The world ignored Hitler's words, and paid a terrible price. 
		His Nazi regime killed millions in the gas chambers, and set the world 
		aflame in war, before it was finally defeated at a terrible cost in 
		lives.Bin Laden and his terrorist allies have made their 
		intentions as clear as Lenin and Hitler before them. The question is: 
		Will we listen? Will we pay attention to what these evil men say? 
		America and our coalition partners have made our choice. We're taking 
		the words of the enemy seriously. We're on the offensive, and we will 
		not rest, we will not retreat, and we will not withdraw from the fight, 
		until this threat to civilization has been removed.Five years into this struggle, it's important to 
		take stock of what's been accomplished -- and the difficult work that 
		remains. Al Qaeda has been weakened by our sustained offensive against 
		them, and today it is harder for al Qaeda's leaders to operate freely, 
		to move money, or to communicate with their operatives and facilitators. 
		Yet al Qaeda remains dangerous and determined. Bin Laden and Zawahiri 
		remain in hiding in remote regions of this world. Al Qaeda continues to 
		adapt in the face of our global campaign against them. Increasingly, al 
		Qaeda is taking advantage of the Internet to disseminate propaganda, and 
		to conduct ""virtual recruitment"" and ""virtual training"" of new 
		terrorists. Al Qaeda's leaders no longer need to meet face-to-face with 
		their operatives. They can find new suicide bombers, and facilitate new 
		terrorist attacks, without ever laying eyes on those they're training, 
		financing, or sending to strike us.As al Qaeda changes, the broader terrorist movement 
		is also changing, becoming more dispersed and self-directed. More and 
		more, we're facing threats from locally established terrorist cells that 
		are inspired by al Qaeda's ideology and goals, but do not necessarily 
		have direct links to al Qaeda, such as training and funding. Some of 
		these groups are made up of ""homegrown"" terrorists, militant extremists 
		who were born and educated in Western nations, were indoctrinated by 
		radical Islamists or attracted to their ideology, and joined the violent 
		extremist cause. These locally established cells appear to be 
		responsible for a number of attacks and plots, including those in 
		Madrid, and Canada, and other countries across the world.As we continue to fight al Qaeda and these Sunni 
		extremists inspired by their radical ideology, we also face the threat 
		posed by Shia extremists, who are learning from al Qaeda, increasing 
		their assertiveness, and stepping up their threats. Like the vast 
		majority of Sunnis, the vast majority of Shia across the world reject 
		the vision of extremists -- and in Iraq, millions of Shia have defied 
		terrorist threats to vote in free elections, and have shown their desire 
		to live in freedom. The Shia extremists want to deny them this right. 
		This Shia strain of Islamic radicalism is just as dangerous, and just as 
		hostile to America, and just as determined to establish its brand of 
		hegemony across the broader Middle East. And the Shia extremists have 
		achieved something that al Qaeda has so far failed to do: In 1979, they 
		took control of a major power, the nation of Iran, subjugating its proud 
		people to a regime of tyranny, and using that nation's resources to fund 
		the spread of terror and pursue their radical agenda.Like al Qaeda and the Sunni extremists, the Iranian 
		regime has clear aims: They want to drive America out of the region, to 
		destroy Israel, and to dominate the broader Middle East. To achieve 
		these aims, they are funding and arming terrorist groups like Hezbollah, 
		which allow them to attack Israel and America by proxy. Hezbollah, the 
		source of the current instability in Lebanon, has killed more Americans 
		than any terrorist organization except al Qaeda. Unlike al Qaeda, 
		they've not yet attacked the American homeland. Yet they're directly 
		responsible for the murder of hundreds of Americans abroad. It was 
		Hezbollah that was behind the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracksin Beirut that killed 241 Americans. And Saudi Hezbollah was behind the1996 bombing of Khobar Towersin Saudi Arabia that killed 19 Americans, 
		an attack conducted by terrorists who we believe were working with 
		Iranian officials.Just as we must take the words of the Sunni 
		extremists seriously, we must take the words of the Shia extremists 
		seriously. Listen to the words of Hezbollah's leader, the terroristNasrallah, who has declared his hatred of America. He says, ""Let the 
		entire world hear me. Our hostility to the Great Satan [America] is 
		absolute... Regardless of how the world has changed after 11 September, 
		Death to America will remain our reverberating and powerful slogan: 
		Death to America.""Iran's leaders, who back Hezbollah, have also 
		declared their absolute hostility to America. Last October, Iran's 
		President declared in a speech that some people ask -- in his words -- 
		""whether a world without the United States and Zionism can be achieved...I say that this...goal is achievable."" Less than three months ago, Iran's 
		President declared to America and other Western powers: ""open your eyes 
		and see the fate of pharaoh... if you do not abandon the path of 
		falsehood...your doomed destiny will be annihilation."" Less than two 
		months ago, he warned: ""The anger of Muslims may reach an explosion 
		point soon. If such a day comes...[America and the West] should know that 
		the waves of the blast will not remain within the boundaries of our 
		region."" He also delivered this message to the American people: ""If you 
		would like to have good relations with the Iranian nation in the future...bow down before the greatness of the Iranian nation and surrender. If 
		you don't accept [to do this], the Iranian nation will...force you to 
		surrender and bow down.""America will not bow down to tyrants.The Iranian regime and its terrorist proxies have 
		demonstrated their willingness to kill Americans -- and now the Iranian 
		regime is pursuing nuclear weapons. The world is working together to 
		prevent Iran's regime from acquiring the tools of mass murder. The 
		international community has made a reasonable proposal to Iran's 
		leaders, and given them the opportunity to set their nation on a better 
		course. So far, Iran's leaders have rejected this offer. Their choice is 
		increasingly isolating the great Iranian nation from the international 
		community, and denying the Iranian people an opportunity for greater 
		economic prosperity. It's time for Iran's leader to make a different 
		choice. And we've made our choice. We'll continue to work closely with 
		our allies to find a diplomatic solution. The world's free nations will 
		not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.The Shia and Sunni extremists represent different 
		faces of the same threat. They draw inspiration from different sources, 
		but both seek to impose a dark vision of violent Islamic radicalism 
		across the Middle East. They oppose the advance of freedom, and they 
		want to gain control of weapons of mass destruction. If they succeed in 
		undermining fragile democracies, like Iraq, and drive the forces of 
		freedom out of the region, they will have an open field to pursue their 
		dangerous goals. Each strain of violent Islamic radicalism would be 
		emboldened in their efforts to topple moderate governments and establish 
		terrorist safe havens.Imagine a world in which they were able to control 
		governments, a world awash with oil and they would use oil resources to 
		punish industrialized nations. And they would use those resources to 
		fuel their radical agenda, and pursue and purchase weapons of mass 
		murder. And armed with nuclear weapons, they would blackmail the free 
		world, and spread their ideologies of hate, and raise a mortal threat to 
		the American people. If we allow them to do this, if we retreat from 
		Iraq, if we don't uphold our duty to support those who are desirous to 
		live in liberty, 50 years from now history will look back on our time 
		with unforgiving clarity, and demand to know why we did not act.I'm not going to allow this to happen -- and no 
		future American President can allow it either. America did not seek this 
		global struggle, but we're answering history's call with confidence and 
		a clear strategy. Today we're releasing a document called the ""National 
		Strategy for Combating Terrorism."" This is an unclassified version 
		of the strategy we've been pursuing since September the 11th, 2001. This 
		strategy was first released in February 2003; it's been updated to take 
		into account the changing nature of this enemy. This strategy document 
		is posted on the White House website -- whitehouse.gov. And I urge all 
		Americans to read it.Our strategy for combating terrorism has five basic 
		elements:First, we're determined to prevent terrorist 
		attacks before they occur. So we're taking the fight to the enemy. The 
		best way to protect America is to stay on the offense. Since 9/11, our 
		coalition has captured or killed al Qaeda managers and operatives, and 
		scores of other terrorists across the world. The enemy is living under 
		constant pressure, and we intend to keep it that way -- and this adds to 
		our security. When terrorists spend their days working to avoid death or 
		capture, it's harder for them to plan and execute new attacks.We're also fighting the enemy here at home. We've 
		given our law enforcement and intelligence professionals the tools they 
		need to stop the terrorists in our midst. We passedthe Patriot Actto 
		break down the wall that prevented law enforcement and intelligence from 
		sharing vital information. We created theTerrorist Surveillance Programto monitor the communications between al Qaeda commanders abroad and 
		terrorist operatives within our borders. If al Qaeda is calling somebody 
		in America, we need to know why, in order to stop attacks.I want to thank these three Senators for working 
		with us to give our law enforcement and intelligence officers the tools 
		necessary to do their jobs.  And over the last five years, federal, 
		state, and local law enforcement have used those tools to break up 
		terrorist cells, and to prosecute terrorist operatives and supporters in 
		New York, and Oregon, and Virginia, and Texas, and New Jersey, and 
		Illinois, Ohio, and other states. By taking the battle to the terrorists 
		and their supporters on our own soil and across the world, we've stopped 
		a number of al Qaeda plots.Second, we're determined to deny weapons of mass 
		destruction to outlaw regimes and terrorists who would use them without 
		hesitation. Working with Great Britain and Pakistan and other nations, 
		the United States shut down the world's most dangerous nuclear trading 
		cartel, theAQ Khannetwork. This network had supplied Iran and Libya 
		and North Korea with equipment and know-how that advanced their efforts 
		to obtain nuclear weapons. And we launched theProliferation Security 
		Initiative, a coalition of more than 70 nations that is working together 
		to stop shipments related to weapons of mass destruction on land, at 
		sea, and in the air. The greatest threat this world faces is the danger 
		of extremists and terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction -- 
		and this is a threat America cannot defeat on her own. We applaud the 
		determined efforts of many nations around the world to stop the spread 
		of these dangerous weapons. Together, we pledge we'll continue to work 
		together to stop the world's most dangerous men from getting their hands 
		on the world's most dangerous weapons.Third, we're determined to deny terrorists the 
		support of outlaw regimes. After September the 11th, I laid out a clear 
		doctrine: America makes no distinction between those who commit acts of 
		terror, and those that harbor and support them, because they're equally 
		guilty of murder. Thanks to our efforts, there are now three fewer state 
		sponsors of terror in the world than there were on September the 11th, 
		2001. Afghanistan and Iraq have been transformed from terrorist states 
		into allies in the war on terror. And the nation of Libya has renounced 
		terrorism, and given up its weapons of mass destruction programs, and 
		its nuclear materials and equipment. Over the past five years, we've 
		acted to disrupt the flow of weapons and support from terrorist states 
		to terrorist networks. And we have made clear that any government that 
		chooses to be an ally of terror has also chosen to be an enemy of 
		civilization.Fourth, we're determined to deny terrorist networks 
		control of any nation, or territory within a nation. So, along with our 
		coalition and the Iraqi government, we'll stop the terrorists from 
		taking control of Iraq, and establishing a new safe haven from which to 
		attack America and the free world. And we're working with friends and 
		allies to deny the terrorists the enclaves they seek to establish in 
		ungoverned areas across the world. By helping governments reclaim full 
		sovereign control over their territory, we make ourselves more secure.Fifth, we're working to deny terrorists new 
		recruits, by defeating their hateful ideology and spreading the hope of 
		freedom -- by spreading the hope of freedom across the Middle East. For 
		decades, American policy sought to achieve peace in the Middle East by 
		pursuing stability at the expense of liberty. The lack of freedom in 
		that region helped create conditions where anger and resentment grew, 
		and radicalism thrived, and terrorists found willing recruits. And we 
		saw the consequences on September the 11th, when the terrorists brought 
		death and destruction to our country. The policy wasn't working.The experience of September the 11th made clear, in 
		the long run, the only way to secure our nation is to change the course 
		of the Middle East. So America has committed its influence in the world 
		to advancing freedom and liberty and democracy as the great alternatives 
		to repression and radicalism.  We're taking the side of democratic 
		leaders and moderates and reformers across the Middle East. We strongly 
		support the voices of tolerance and moderation in the Muslim world. 
		We're standing with Afghanistan's elected government against al Qaeda 
		and the Taliban remnants that are trying to restore tyranny in that 
		country. We're standing with Lebanon's young democracy against the 
		foreign forces that are seeking to undermine the country's sovereignty 
		and independence. And we're standing with the leaders of Iraq's unity 
		government as they work to defeat the enemies of freedom, and chart a 
		more hopeful course for their people. This is why victory is so 
		important in Iraq. By helping freedom succeed in Iraq, we will help 
		America, and the Middle East, and the world become more secure.During the last five years we've learned a lot 
		about this enemy. We've learned that they're cunning and sophisticated. 
		We've witnessed their ability to change their methods and their tactics 
		with deadly speed -- even as their murderous obsessions remain 
		unchanging. We've seen that it's the terrorists who have declared war on 
		Muslims, slaughtering huge numbers of innocent Muslim men and women 
		around the world.We know what the terrorists believe, we know what 
		they have done, and we know what they intend to do. And now the world's 
		free nations must summon the will to meet this great challenge. The road 
		ahead is going to be difficult, and it will require more sacrifice. Yet 
		we can have confidence in the outcome, because we've seen freedom 
		conquer tyranny and terror before. In the 20th century, free nations 
		confronted and defeated Nazi Germany. During the Cold War, we confronted 
		Soviet communism, and today Europe is whole, free and at peace.And now, freedom is once again contending with the 
		forces of darkness and tyranny. This time, the battle is unfolding in a 
		new region -- the broader Middle East. This time, we're not waiting for 
		our enemies to gather in strength. This time, we're confronting them 
		before they gain the capacity to inflict unspeakable damage on the 
		world, and we're confronting their hateful ideology before it fully 
		takes root.We see a day when people across the Middle East 
		have governments that honor their dignity, and unleash their creativity, 
		and count their votes. We see a day when across this region citizens are 
		allowed to express themselves freely, women have full rights, and 
		children are educated and given the tools necessary to succeed in life. 
		And we see a day when all the nations of the Middle East are allies in 
		the cause of peace.We fight for this day, because the security of our 
		own citizens depends on it. This is the great ideological struggle of 
		the 21st century -- and it is the calling of our generation. All 
		civilized nations are bound together in this struggle between moderation 
		and extremism. By coming together, we will roll back this grave threat 
		to our way of life. We will help the people of the Middle East claim 
		their freedom, and we will leave a safer and more hopeful world for our 
		children and grandchildren.God bless.",thank much thank please seat general hendrix thank invitation thank kind introduction honor stand men woman themilitary officer association america appreciate

Military Commissions to Try Suspected Terroristsdelivered 6 
September 2006, White House, Washington, D.C.Audio 
		mp3 of AddressPlug-in required for flash audioYour browser does not support the audio element.click 
for pdfWelcome to the White House. Mr. Vice President, Secretary 
		Rice, Attorney General Gonzales, Ambassador Negroponte, General Hayden, 
		members of the United States Congress, families who lost loved ones in 
		the terrorist attacks on our nation, and my fellow citizens: Thanks for 
		coming.On the morning of 
		September the 11th, 2001, our nation awoke to a nightmare attack. 
		Nineteen men, armed with box cutters, took control of airplanes and 
		turned them into missiles. They used them to kill nearly 3,000 innocent 
		people. We watched the Twin Towers collapse before our eyes -- and it 
		became instantly clear that we'd entered a new world, and a dangerous 
		new war.The attacks of September 
		the 11th horrified our nation. And amid the grief came new fears and 
		urgent questions: Who had attacked us? What did they want? And what else 
		were they planning? Americans saw the destruction the terrorists had 
		caused in New York, and Washington, and Pennsylvania, and they wondered 
		if there were other terrorist cells in our midst poised to strike; they 
		wondered if there was a second wave of attacks still to come.With the Twin Towers and 
		the Pentagon still smoldering, our country on edge, and a stream of 
		intelligence coming in about potential new attacks, my Administration 
		faced immediate challenges: We had to respond to the attack on our 
		country. We had to wage an unprecedented war against an enemy unlike any 
		we had fought before. We had to find the terrorists hiding in America 
		and across the world, before they were able to strike our country again. 
		So in the early days and weeks after 9/11, I directed our government's 
		senior national security officials to do everything in their power, 
		within our laws, to prevent another attack.Nearly five years have 
		passed since these -- those initial days of shock and sadness -- and we 
		are thankful that the terrorists have not succeeded in launching another 
		attack on our soil. This is not for the lack of desire or determination 
		on the part of the enemy. As the recently foiled plot in London shows, 
		the terrorists are still active, and they're still trying to strike 
		America, and they're still trying to kill our people. One reason the 
		terrorists have not succeeded is because of the hard work of thousands 
		of dedicated men and women in our government, who have toiled day and 
		night, along with our allies, to stop the enemy from carrying out their 
		plans. And we are grateful for these hardworking citizens of ours.Another reason the 
		terrorists have not succeeded is because our government has changed its 
		policies -- and given our military, intelligence, and law enforcement 
		personnel the tools they need to fight this enemy and protect our people 
		and preserve our freedoms.The terrorists who 
		declared war on America represent no nation, they defend no territory, 
		and they wear no uniform. They do not mass armies on borders, or 
		flotillas of warships on the high seas. They operate in the shadows of 
		society; they send small teams of operatives to infiltrate free nations; 
		they live quietly among their victims; they conspire in secret, and then 
		they strike without warning. In this new war, the most important source 
		of information on where the terrorists are hiding and what they are 
		planning is the terrorists, themselves. Captured terrorists have unique 
		knowledge about how terrorist networks operate. They have knowledge of 
		where their operatives are deployed, and knowledge about what plots are 
		underway. This intelligence -- this is intelligence that cannot be found 
		any other place. And our security depends on getting this kind of 
		information. To win the war on terror, we must be able to detain, 
		question, and, when appropriate, prosecute terrorists captured here in 
		America, and on the battlefields around the world.After the 9/11 attacks, 
		our coalition launched operations across the world to remove terrorist 
		safe havens, and capture or kill terrorist operatives and leaders. 
		Working with our allies, we've captured and detained thousands of 
		terrorists and enemy fighters in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and other fronts 
		of this war on terror. These enemy -- these are enemy combatants, who 
		were waging war on our nation. We have a right under the laws of war, 
		and we have an obligation to the American people, to detain these 
		enemies and stop them from rejoining the battle.Most of the enemy 
		combatants we capture are held in Afghanistan or in Iraq, where they're 
		questioned by our military personnel. Many are released after 
		questioning, or turned over to local authorities -- if we determine that 
		they do not pose a continuing threat and no longer have significant 
		intelligence value. Others remain in American custody near the 
		battlefield, to ensure that they don't return to the fight.In some cases, we 
		determine that individuals we have captured pose a significant threat, 
		or may have intelligence that we and our allies need to have to prevent 
		new attacks. Many are al Qaeda operatives or Taliban fighters trying to 
		conceal their identities, and they withhold information that could save 
		American lives. In these cases, it has been necessary to move these 
		individuals to an environment where they can be held secretly [sic], 
		questioned by experts, and -- when appropriate -- prosecuted for 
		terrorist acts.Some of these 
		individuals are taken to theUnited States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, 
		Cuba. It's important for Americans and others across the world to 
		understand the kind of people held at Guantanamo. These aren't common 
		criminals, or bystanders accidentally swept up on the battlefield -- we 
		have in place a rigorous process to ensure those held at Guantanamo Bay 
		belong at Guantanamo. Those held at Guantanamo include suspected bomb 
		makers, terrorist trainers, recruiters and facilitators, and potential 
		suicide bombers. They are in our custody so they cannot murder our 
		people. One detainee held at Guantanamo told a questioner questioning 
		him -- he said this: ""I'll never forget your face. I will kill you, your 
		brothers, your mother, and sisters.""In addition to the 
		terrorists held at Guantanamo, a small number of suspected terrorist 
		leaders and operatives captured during the war have been held and 
		questioned outside the United States, in a separate program operated by 
		the Central Intelligence Agency. This group includes individuals 
		believed to be the key architects of the September the 11th attacks, and 
		attacks on the USS Cole, an operative involved in the bombings of our 
		embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and individuals involved in other 
		attacks that have taken the lives of innocent civilians across the 
		world. These are dangerous men with unparalleled knowledge about 
		terrorist networks and their plans for new attacks. The security of our 
		nation and the lives of our citizens depend on our ability to learn what 
		these terrorists know.Many specifics of this 
		program, including where these detainees have been held and the details 
		of their confinement, cannot be divulged. Doing so would provide our 
		enemies with information they could use to take retribution against our 
		allies and harm our country. I can say that questioning the detainees in 
		this program has given us information that has saved innocent lives by 
		helping us stop new attacks -- here in the United States and across the 
		world. Today, I'm going to share with you some of the examples provided 
		by our intelligence community of how this program has saved lives; why 
		it remains vital to the security of the United States, and our friends 
		and allies; and why it deserves the support of the United States 
		Congress and the American people.Within months of September 
		the 11th, 2001, we captured a man known as Abu Zubaydah. We believe that 
		Zubaydah was a senior terrorist leader and a trusted associate of Osama 
		bin Laden. Our intelligence community believes he had run a terrorist 
		camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trained, and that 
		he helped smuggle al Qaeda leaders out of Afghanistan after coalition 
		forces arrived to liberate that country. Zubaydah was severely wounded 
		during the firefight that brought him into custody -- and he survived 
		only because of the medical care arranged by the CIA.After he recovered, 
		Zubaydah was defiant and evasive. He declared his hatred of America. 
		During questioning, he at first disclosed what he thought was nominal 
		information -- and then stopped all cooperation. Well, in fact, the 
		""nominal"" information he gave us turned out to be quite important. For 
		example, Zubaydah disclosed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- or KSM -- was the 
		mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, and used the alias ""Muktar."" This 
		was a vital piece of the puzzle that helped our intelligence community 
		pursue KSM. Abu Zubaydah also provided information that helped stop a 
		terrorist attack being planned for inside the United States -- an attack 
		about which we had no previous information. Zubaydah told us that al 
		Qaeda operatives were planning to launch an attack in the U.S., and 
		provided physical descriptions of the operatives and information on 
		their general location. Based on the information he provided, the 
		operatives were detained -- one while traveling to the United States.We knew that Zubaydah had 
		more information that could save innocent lives, but he stopped talking. 
		As his questioning proceeded, it became clear that he had received 
		training on how to resist interrogation. And so the CIA used an 
		alternative set of procedures. These procedures were designed to be 
		safe, to comply with our laws, our Constitution, and our treaty 
		obligations. The Department of Justice reviewed the authorized methods 
		extensively and determined them to be lawful. I cannot describe the 
		specific methods used -- I think you understand why -- if I did, it 
		would help the terrorists learn how to resist questioning, and to keep 
		information from us that we need to prevent new attacks on our country. 
		But I can say the procedures were tough, and they were safe, and lawful, 
		and necessary.Zubaydah was questioned 
		using these procedures, and soon he began to provide information on key 
		al Qaeda operatives, including information that helped us find and 
		capture more of those responsible for the attacks on September the 11th. 
		For example, Zubaydah identified one of KSM's accomplices in the 9/11 
		attacks -- a terrorist named Ramzi bin al Shibh. The information 
		Zubaydah provided helped lead to the capture of bin al Shibh. And 
		together these two terrorists provided information that helped in the 
		planning and execution of the operation that captured Khalid Sheikh 
		Mohammed.Once in our custody, KSM 
		was questioned by the CIA using these procedures, and he soon provided 
		information that helped us stop another planned attack on the United 
		States. During questioning, KSM told us about another al Qaeda operative 
		he knew was in CIA custody -- a terrorist named Majid Khan. KSM revealed 
		that Khan had been told to deliver $50,000 to individuals working for a 
		suspected terrorist leader named Hambali, the leader of al Qaeda's 
		Southeast Asian affiliate known as ""J-I"". CIA officers confronted Khan 
		with this information. Khan confirmed that the money had been delivered 
		to an operative named Zubair, and provided both a physical description 
		and contact number for this operative.Based on that information, 
		Zubair was captured in June of 2003, and he soon provided information 
		that helped lead to the capture of Hambali. After Hambali's arrest, KSM 
		was questioned again. He identified Hambali's brother as the leader of a 
		""J-I"" cell, and Hambali's conduit for communications with al Qaeda. 
		Hambali's brother was soon captured in Pakistan, and, in turn, led us to 
		a cell of 17 Southeast Asian ""J-I"" operatives. When confronted with the 
		news that his terror cell had been broken up, Hambali admitted that the 
		operatives were being groomed at KSM's request for attacks inside the 
		United States -- probably [sic] using airplanes.During questioning, KSM 
		also provided many details of other plots to kill innocent Americans. 
		For example, he described the design of planned attacks on buildings 
		inside the United States, and how operatives were directed to carry them 
		out. He told us the operatives had been instructed to ensure that the 
		explosives went off at a point that was high enough to prevent the 
		people trapped above from escaping out the windows.KSM also provided vital 
		information on al Qaeda's efforts to obtain biological weapons. During 
		questioning, KSM admitted that he had met three individuals involved in 
		al Qaeda's efforts to produce anthrax, a deadly biological agent -- and 
		he identified one of the individuals as a terrorist named Yazid. KSM 
		apparently believed we already had this information, because Yazid had 
		been captured and taken into foreign custody before KSM's arrest. In 
		fact, we did not know about Yazid's role in al Qaeda's anthrax program. 
		Information from Yazid then helped lead to the capture of his two 
		principal assistants in the anthrax program. Without the information 
		provided by KSM and Yazid, we might not have uncovered this al Qaeda 
		biological weapons program, or stopped this al Qaeda cell from 
		developing anthrax for attacks against the United States.These are some of the 
		plots that have been stopped because of the information of this vital 
		program. Terrorists held in CIA custody have also provided information 
		that helped stop a planned strike on U.S. Marines at Camp Lemonier in 
		Djibouti -- they were going to use an explosive laden water tanker. They 
		helped stop a planned attack on the U.S. consulate in Karachi using car 
		bombs and motorcycle bombs, and they helped stop a plot to hijack 
		passenger planes and fly them into Heathrow or the Canary Wharf in 
		London.We're getting vital 
		information necessary to do our jobs, and that's to protect the American 
		people and our allies.Information from the 
		terrorists in this program has helped us to identify individuals that al 
		Qaeda deemed suitable for Western operations, many of whom we had never 
		heard about before. They include terrorists who were set to case targets 
		inside the United States, including financial buildings in major cities 
		on the East Coast. Information from terrorists in CIA custody has played 
		a role in the capture or questioning of nearly every senior al Qaeda 
		member or associate detained by the U.S. and its allies since this 
		program began. By providing everything from initial leads to photo 
		identifications, to precise locations of where terrorists were hiding, 
		this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the 
		streets before they were able to kill.This program has also 
		played a critical role in helping us understand the enemy we face in 
		this war. Terrorists in this program have painted a picture of al 
		Qaeda's structure and financing, and communications and logistics. They 
		identified al Qaeda's travel routes and safe havens, and explained how 
		al Qaeda's senior leadership communicates with its operatives in places 
		like Iraq. They provided information that allows us -- that has allowed 
		us to make sense of documents and computer records that we have seized 
		in terrorist raids. They've identified voices in recordings of 
		intercepted calls, and helped us understand the meaning of potentially 
		critical terrorist communications.The information we get 
		from these detainees is corroborated by intelligence, and we've received 
		-- that we've received from other sources -- and together this 
		intelligence has helped us connect the dots and stop attacks before they 
		occur. Information from the terrorists questioned in this program helped 
		unravel plots and terrorist cells in Europe and in other places. It's 
		helped our allies protect their people from deadly enemies. This program 
		has been, and remains, one of the most vital tools in our war against 
		the terrorists. It is invaluable to America and to our allies. Were it 
		not for this program, our intelligence community believes that al Qaeda 
		and its allies would have succeeded in launching another attack against 
		the American homeland. By giving us information about terrorist plans we 
		could not get anywhere else, this program has saved innocent lives.This program has been 
		subject to multiple legal reviews by the Department of Justice and CIA 
		lawyers; they've determined it complied with our laws. This program has 
		received strict oversight by the CIA's Inspector General. A small number 
		of key leaders from both political parties on Capitol Hill were briefed 
		about this program. All those involved in the questioning of the 
		terrorists are carefully chosen and they're screened from a pool of 
		experienced CIA officers. Those selected to conduct the most sensitive 
		questioning had to complete more than 250 additional hours of 
		specialized training before they are allowed to have contact with a 
		captured terrorist.I want to be absolutely 
		clear with our people, and the world: The United States does not 
		torture. It's against our laws, and it's against our values. I have not 
		authorized it -- and I will not authorize it. Last year, my 
		Administration worked with Senator John McCain, and I signed into law 
		the Detainee Treatment Act, which established the legal standard for 
		treatment of detainees wherever they are held. I support this act. And 
		as we implement this law, our government will continue to use every 
		lawful method to obtain intelligence that can protect innocent people, 
		and stop another attack like the one we experienced on September the 
		11th, 2001.The CIA program has 
		detained only a limited number of terrorists at any given time -- and 
		once we've determined that the terrorists held by the CIA have little or 
		no additional intelligence value, many of them have been returned to 
		their home countries for prosecution or detention by their governments. 
		Others have been accused of terrible crimes against the American people, 
		and we have a duty to bring those responsible for these crimes to 
		justice. So we intend to prosecute these men, as appropriate, for their 
		crimes.Soon after the war on 
		terror began, I authorized a system of military commissions to try 
		foreign terrorists accused of war crimes. Military commissions have been 
		used by Presidents from George Washington to Franklin Roosevelt to 
		prosecute war criminals, because the rules for trying enemy combatants 
		in a time of conflict must be different from those for trying common 
		criminals or members of our own military. One of the first suspected 
		terrorists to be put on trial by military commission was one of Osama 
		bin Laden's bodyguards -- a man named Hamdan. His lawyers challenged the 
		legality of the military commission system. It took more than two years 
		for this case to make its way through the courts. The Court of Appeals 
		for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the military commissions we 
		had designed, but this past June, the Supreme Court overturned that 
		decision. The Supreme Court determined that military commissions are an 
		appropriate venue for trying terrorists, but ruled that military 
		commissions needed to be explicitly authorized by the United States 
		Congress.So today,I'm sending 
		Congress legislationto specifically authorize the creation of military 
		commissions to try terrorists for war crimes. My Administration has been 
		working with members of both parties in the House and Senate on this 
		legislation. We put forward a bill that ensures these commissions are 
		established in a way that protects our national security, and ensures a 
		full and fair trial for those accused. The procedures in the bill I am 
		sending to Congress today reflect the reality that we are a nation at 
		war, and that it's essential for us to use all reliable evidence to 
		bring these people to justice.We're now approaching thefive-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks-- and the families of those 
		murdered that day have waited patiently for justice. Some of the 
		families are with us today -- they should have to wait no longer. So I'm 
		announcing today that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi bin 
		al-Shibh, and 11 other terrorists in CIA custody have been transferred 
		to the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay. They are being held 
		in the custody of the Department of Defense. As soon as Congress acts to 
		authorize the military commissions I have proposed, the men our 
		intelligence officials believe orchestrated the deaths of nearly 3,000 
		Americans on September the 11th, 2001, can face justice.We'll also seek to 
		prosecute those believed to be responsible for the attack on the USS 
		Cole, and an operative believed to be involved in the bombings of the 
		American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. With these prosecutions, we 
		will send a clear message to those who kill Americans: No longer -- how 
		long it takes, we will find you and we will bring you to justice.These men will be held in 
		a high-security facility at Guantanamo. The International Committee of 
		the Red Cross is being advised of their detention, and will have the 
		opportunity to meet with them. Those charged with crimes will be given 
		access to attorneys who will help them prepare their defense -- and they 
		will be presumed innocent. While at Guantanamo, they will have access to 
		the same food, clothing, medical care, and opportunities for worship as 
		other detainees. They will be questioned subject to the new U.S. Army 
		Field Manual, which the Department of Defense is issuing today. And they 
		will continue to be treated with the humanity that they denied others.As we move forward with 
		the prosecutions, we will continue to urge nations across the world to 
		take back their nationals at Guantanamo who will not be prosecuted by 
		our military commissions. America has no interest in being the world's 
		jailer. But one of the reasons we have not been able to close Guantanamo 
		is that many countries have refused to take back their nationals held at 
		the facility. Other countries have not provided adequate assurances that 
		their nationals will not be mistreated -- or they will not return to the 
		battlefield, as more than a dozen people released from Guantanamo 
		already have. We will continue working to transfer individuals held at 
		Guantanamo, and ask other countries to work with us in this process. And 
		we will move toward the day when we can eventually close the detention 
		facility at Guantanamo Bay.I know Americans have 
		heard conflicting information about Guantanamo. Let me give you some 
		facts. Of the thousands of terrorists captured across the world, only 
		about 770 have ever been sent to Guantanamo. Of these, about 315 have 
		been returned to other countries so far -- and about 455 remain in our 
		custody. They are provided the same quality of medical care as the 
		American service members who guard them. The International Committee of 
		the Red Cross has the opportunity to meet privately with all who are 
		held there. The facility has been visited by government officials from 
		more than 30 countries, and delegations from international 
		organizations, as well. After the Organization for Security and 
		Cooperation in Europe came to visit, one of its delegation members 
		called Guantanamo ""a model prison"" where people are treated better than 
		in prisons in his own country. Our troops can take great pride in the 
		work they do at Guantanamo Bay -- and so can the American people.As we prosecute suspected 
		terrorist leaders and operatives who have now been transferred to 
		Guantanamo, we'll continue searching for those who have stepped forward 
		to take their places. This nation is going to stay on the offense to 
		protect the American people. We will continue to bring the world's most 
		dangerous terrorists to justice -- and we will continue working to 
		collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country. The 
		current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA 
		program. But as more high-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to 
		obtain intelligence from them will remain critical -- and having a CIA 
		program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to 
		getting life-saving information.Some may ask: Why are you 
		acknowledging this program now? There are two reasons why I'm making 
		these limited disclosures today. First, we have largely completed our 
		questioning of the men -- and to start the process for bringing them to 
		trial, we must bring them into the open. Second, the Supreme Court's 
		recent decision has impaired our ability to prosecute terrorists through 
		military commissions, and has put in question the future of the CIA 
		program. In its ruling on military commissions, the Court determined 
		that a provision of the Geneva Conventions known as ""Common Article 
		Three"" applies to our war with al Qaeda. This article includes 
		provisions that prohibit ""outrages upon personal dignity"" and 
		""humiliating and degrading treatment."" The problem is that these and 
		other provisions of Common Article Three are vague and undefined, and 
		each could be interpreted in different ways by American or foreign 
		judges. And some believe our military and intelligence personnel 
		involved in capturing and questioning terrorists could now be at risk of 
		prosecution under the War Crimes Act -- simply for doing their jobs in a 
		thorough and professional way.This is unacceptable. Our 
		military and intelligence personnel go face to face with the world's 
		most dangerous men every day. They have risked their lives to capture 
		some of the most brutal terrorists on Earth. And they have worked day 
		and night to find out what the terrorists know so we can stop new 
		attacks. America owes our brave men and women some things in return. We 
		owe them their thanks for saving lives and keeping America safe. And we 
		owe them clear rules, so they can continue to do their jobs and protect 
		our people.So today, I'm asking 
		Congress to pass legislation that will clarify the rules for our 
		personnel fighting the war on terror. First, I'm asking Congress to list 
		the specific, recognizable offenses that would be considered crimes 
		under the War Crimes Act -- so our personnel can know clearly what is 
		prohibited in the handling of terrorist enemies. Second, I'm asking that 
		Congress make explicit that by following the standards of the Detainee 
		Treatment Act our personnel are fulfilling America's obligations under 
		Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions. Third, I'm asking that 
		Congress make it clear that captured terrorists cannot use the Geneva 
		Conventions as a basis to sue our personnel in courts -- in U.S. courts. 
		The men and women who protect us should not have to fear lawsuits filed 
		by terrorists because they're doing their jobs.The need for this 
		legislation is urgent. We need to ensure that those questioning 
		terrorists can continue to do everything within the limits of the law to 
		get information that can save American lives. My Administration will 
		continue to work with the Congress to get this legislation enacted -- 
		but time is of the essence. Congress is in session just for a few more 
		weeks, and passing this legislation ought to be the top priority.As we work with Congress 
		to pass a good bill, we will also consult with congressional leaders on 
		how to ensure that the CIA program goes forward in a way that follows 
		the law, that meets the national security needs of our country, and 
		protects the brave men and women we ask to obtain information that will 
		save innocent lives. For the sake of our security, Congress needs to 
		act, and update our laws to meet the threats of this new era. And I know 
		they will.We're engaged in a global 
		struggle -- and the entire civilized world has a stake in its outcome. 
		America is a nation of law. And as I work with Congress to strengthen 
		and clarify our laws here at home, I will continue to work with members 
		of the international community who have been our partners in this 
		struggle. I've spoken with leaders of foreign governments, and worked 
		with them to address their concerns about Guantanamo and our detention 
		policies. I'll continue to work with the international community to 
		construct a common foundation to defend our nations and protect our 
		freedoms.Free nations have faced 
		new enemies and adjusted to new threats before -- and we have prevailed. 
		Like the struggles of the last century, today's war on terror is, above 
		all, a struggle for freedom and liberty. The adversaries are different, 
		but the stakes in this war are the same: We're fighting for our way of 
		life, and our ability to live in freedom. We're fighting for the cause 
		of humanity, against those who seek to impose the darkness of tyranny 
		and terror upon the entire world. And we're fighting for a peaceful 
		future for our children and our grandchildren.May God bless you all.",mmissions try suspect military commission try suspect terroristsdelivered september white house washington require flash

			Anniversary of 9/11delivered 11 September

for pdfGood evening. Five years ago, this 
			date -- September the 11th -- was seared into America's memory. 
			Nineteen men attacked us with a barbarity unequaled in our history. 
			They murdered people of all colors, creeds, and nationalities -- and 
			made war upon the entire free world. Since that day, America and her 
			allies have taken the offensive in a war unlike any we have fought 
			before. Today, we are safer, but we are not yet safe. On this solemn 
			night, I've asked for some of your time to discuss the nature of the 
			threat still before us, what we are doing to protect our nation, and 
			the building of a more hopeful Middle East that holds the key to 
			peace for America and the world.On 9/11, our nation saw the face of 
			evil. Yet on that awful day, we also witnessed something distinctly 
			American: ordinary citizens rising to the occasion, and responding 
			with extraordinary acts of courage. We saw courage in office workers 
			who were trapped on the high floors of burning skyscrapers -- and 
			called home so that their last words to their families would be of 
			comfort and love. We saw courage in passengers aboard Flight 93, who 
			recited the 23rd Psalm -- and then charged the cockpit. And we saw 
			courage in the Pentagon staff who made it out of the flames and 
			smoke -- and ran back in to answer cries for help. On this day, we 
			remember the innocent who lost their lives -- and we pay tribute to 
			those who gave their lives so that others might live.For many of our citizens, the wounds 
			of that morning are still fresh. I've met firefighters and police 
			officers who choke up at the memory of fallen comrades. I've stood 
			with families gathered on a grassy field in Pennsylvania, who take 
			bittersweet pride in loved ones who refused to be victims -- and 
			gave America our first victory in the war on terror. I've sat beside 
			young mothers with children who are now five years old -- and still 
			long for the daddies who will never cradle them in their arms. Out 
			of this suffering, we resolve to honor every man and woman lost. And 
			we seek their lasting memorial in a safer and more hopeful world.Since the horror of 9/11, we've 
			learned a great deal about the enemy. We have learned that they are 
			evil and kill without mercy -- but not without purpose. We have 
			learned that they form a global network of extremists who are driven 
			by a perverted vision of Islam -- a totalitarian ideology that hates 
			freedom, rejects tolerance, and despises all dissent. And we have 
			learned that their goal is to build a radical Islamic empire where 
			women are prisoners in their homes, men are beaten for missing 
			prayer meetings, and terrorists have a safe haven to plan and launch 
			attacks on America and other civilized nations. The war against this 
			enemy is more than a military conflict. It is the decisive 
			ideological struggle of the 21st century, and the calling of our 
			generation.Our nation is being tested in a way 
			that we have not been since the start of the Cold War. We saw what a 
			handful of our enemies can do with box-cutters and plane tickets. We 
			hear their threats to launch even more terrible attacks on our 
			people. And we know that if they were able to get their hands on 
			weapons of mass destruction, they would use them against us. We face 
			an enemy determined to bring death and suffering into our homes. 
			America did not ask for this war, and every American wishes it were 
			over. So do I. But the war is not over -- and it will not be over 
			until either we or the extremists emerge victorious. If we do not 
			defeat these enemies now, we will leave our children to face a 
			Middle East overrun by terrorist states and radical dictators armed 
			with nuclear weapons. We are in a war that will set the course for 
			this new century -- and determine the destiny of millions across the 
			world.For America, 9/11 was more than a 
			tragedy -- it changed the way we look at the world. On September the 
			11th, we resolved that we would go on the offense against our 
			enemies, and we would not distinguish between the terrorists and 
			those who harbor or support them. So we helped drive the Taliban 
			from power in Afghanistan. We put al Qaeda on the run, and killed or 
			captured most of those who planned the 9/11 attacks, including the 
			man believed to be the mastermind, Khalid Sheik Mohammed. He and 
			other suspected terrorists have been questioned by the Central 
			Intelligence Agency, and they provided valuable information that has 
			helped stop attacks in America and across the world. Now these men 
			have been transferred to Guantanamo Bay, so they can be held to 
			account for their actions. Osama bin Laden and other terrorists are 
			still in hiding. Our message to them is clear: No matter how long it 
			takes, America will find you, and we will bring you to justice.On September the 11th, we learned 
			that America must confront threats before they reach our shores, 
			whether those threats come from terrorist networks or terrorist 
			states. I'm often asked why we're in Iraq when Saddam Hussein was 
			not responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The answer is that the regime 
			of Saddam Hussein was a clear threat. My administration, the 
			Congress, and the United Nations saw the threat -- and after 9/11, 
			Saddam's regime posed a risk that the world could not afford to 
			take. The world is safer because Saddam Hussein is no longer in 
			power. And now the challenge is to help the Iraqi people build a 
			democracy that fulfills the dreams of the nearly 12 million Iraqis 
			who came out to vote in free elections last December.Al Qaeda and other extremists from 
			across the world have come to Iraq to stop the rise of a free 
			society in the heart of the Middle East. They have joined the 
			remnants of Saddam's regime and other armed groups to foment 
			sectarian violence and drive us out. Our enemies in Iraq are tough 
			and they are committed -- but so are Iraqi and coalition forces. 
			We're adapting to stay ahead of the enemy, and we are carrying out a 
			clear plan to ensure that a democratic Iraq succeeds.We're training Iraqi troops so they 
			can defend their nation. We're helping Iraq's unity government grow 
			in strength and serve its people. We will not leave until this work 
			is done. Whatever mistakes have been made in Iraq, the worst mistake 
			would be to think that if we pulled out, the terrorists would leave 
			us alone. They will not leave us alone. They will follow us. The 
			safety of America depends on the outcome of the battle in the 
			streets of Baghdad. Osama bin Laden calls this fight ""the Third 
			World War"" -- and he says that victory for the terrorists in Iraq 
			will mean America's ""defeat and disgrace forever."" If we yield Iraq 
			to men like bin Laden, our enemies will be emboldened; they will 
			gain a new safe haven; they will use Iraq's resources to fuel their 
			extremist movement. We will not allow this to happen. America will 
			stay in the fight. Iraq will be a free nation, and a strong ally in 
			the war on terror.We can be confident that our 
			coalition will succeed because the Iraqi people have been steadfast 
			in the face of unspeakable violence. And we can be confident in 
			victory because of the skill and resolve of America's Armed Forces. 
			Every one of our troops is a volunteer, and since the attacks of 
			September the 11th, more than 1.6 million Americans have stepped 
			forward to put on our nation's uniform. In Iraq, Afghanistan, and 
			other fronts in the war on terror, the men and women of our military 
			are making great sacrifices to keep us safe. Some have suffered 
			terrible injuries -- and nearly 3,000 have given their lives. 
			America cherishes their memory. We pray for their families. And we 
			will never back down from the work they have begun.We also honor those who toil day and 
			night to keep our homeland safe, and we are giving them the tools 
			they need to protect our people. We've created the Department of 
			Homeland Security. We have torn down the wall that kept law 
			enforcement and intelligence from sharing information. We've 
			tightened security at our airports and seaports and borders, and 
			we've created new programs to monitor enemy bank records and phone 
			calls. Thanks to the hard work of our law enforcement and 
			intelligence professionals, we have broken up terrorist cells in our 
			midst and saved American lives.Five years after 9/11, our enemies 
			have not succeeded in launching another attack on our soil, but 
			they've not been idle. Al Qaeda and those inspired by its hateful 
			ideology have carried out terrorist attacks in more than two dozen 
			nations. And just last month, they were foiled in a plot to blow up 
			passenger planes headed for the United States. They remain 
			determined to attack America and kill our citizens -- and we are 
			determined to stop them. We'll continue to give the men and women 
			who protect us every resource and legal authority they need to do 
			their jobs.In the first days after the 9/11 
			attacks I promised to use every element of national power to fight 
			the terrorists, wherever we find them. One of the strongest weapons 
			in our arsenal is the power of freedom. The terrorists fear freedom 
			as much as they do our firepower. They are thrown into panic at the 
			sight of an old man pulling the election lever, girls enrolling in 
			schools, or families worshiping God in their own traditions. They 
			know that given a choice, people will choose freedom over their 
			extremist ideology. So their answer is to deny people this choice by 
			raging against the forces of freedom and moderation. This struggle 
			has been called a clash of civilizations. In truth, it is a struggle 
			for civilization. We are fighting to maintain the way of life 
			enjoyed by free nations. And we're fighting for the possibility that 
			good and decent people across the Middle East can raise up societies 
			based on freedom and tolerance and personal dignity.We are now in the early hours of this 
			struggle between tyranny and freedom. Amid the violence, some 
			question whether the people of the Middle East want their freedom, 
			and whether the forces of moderation can prevail. For 60 years, 
			these doubts guided our policies in the Middle East. And then, on a 
			bright September morning, it became clear that the calm we saw in 
			the Middle East was only a mirage. Years of pursuing stability to 
			promote peace had left us with neither. So we changed our policies, 
			and committed America's influence in the world to advancing freedom 
			and democracy as the great alternatives to repression and 
			radicalism.With our help, the people of the 
			Middle East are now stepping forward to claim their freedom. From 
			Kabul to Baghdad to Beirut, there are brave men and women risking 
			their lives each day for the same freedoms that we enjoy. And they 
			have one question for us: Do we have the confidence to do in the 
			Middle East what our fathers and grandfathers accomplished in Europe 
			and Asia? By standing with democratic leaders and reformers, by 
			giving voice to the hopes of decent men and women, we're offering a 
			path away from radicalism. And we are enlisting the most powerful 
			force for peace and moderation in the Middle East: the desire of 
			millions to be free.Across the broader Middle East, the 
			extremists are fighting to prevent such a future. Yet America has 
			confronted evil before, and we have defeated it -- sometimes at the 
			cost of thousands of good men in a single battle. When Franklin 
			Roosevelt vowed to defeat two enemies across two oceans, he could 
			not have foreseen D-Day and Iwo Jima -- but he would not have been 
			surprised at the outcome. When Harry Truman promised American 
			support for free peoples resisting Soviet aggression, he could not 
			have foreseen the rise of the Berlin Wall -- but he would not have 
			been surprised to see it brought down. Throughout our history, 
			America has seen liberty challenged, and every time, we have seen 
			liberty triumph with sacrifice and determination.At the start of this young century, 
			America looks to the day when the people of the Middle East leave 
			the desert of despotism for the fertile gardens of liberty, and 
			resume their rightful place in a world of peace and prosperity. We 
			look to the day when the nations of that region recognize their 
			greatest resource is not the oil in the ground, but the talent and 
			creativity of their people. We look to the day when moms and dads 
			throughout the Middle East see a future of hope and opportunity for 
			their children. And when that good day comes, the clouds of war will 
			part, the appeal of radicalism will decline, and we will leave our 
			children with a better and safer world.On this solemn anniversary, we 
			rededicate ourselves to this cause. Our nation has endured trials, 
			and we face a difficult road ahead. Winning this war will require 
			the determined efforts of a unified country, and we must put aside 
			our differences and work together to meet the test that history has 
			given us. We will defeat our enemies. We will protect our people. 
			And we will lead the 21st century into a shining age of human 
			liberty.Earlier this year, I traveled to the 
			United States Military Academy. I was there to deliver the 
			commencement address to the first class to arrive at West Point 
			after the attacks of September the 11th. That day I met a proud mom 
			named RoseEllen Dowdell. She was there to watch her son, Patrick, 
			accept his commission in the finest Army the world has ever known. A 
			few weeks earlier, RoseEllen had watched her other son, James, 
			graduate from the Fire Academy in New York City. On both these days, 
			her thoughts turned to someone who was not there to share the 
			moment: her husband, Kevin Dowdell. Kevin was one of the 343 
			firefighters who rushed to the burning towers of the World Trade 
			Center on September the 11th -- and never came home. His sons lost 
			their father that day, but not the passion for service he instilled 
			in them. Here is what RoseEllen says about her boys: ""As a mother, I 
			cross my fingers and pray all the time for their safety -- but as 
			worried as I am, I'm also proud, and I know their dad would be, 
			too.""Our nation is blessed to have young 
			Americans like these -- and we will need them. Dangerous enemies 
			have declared their intention to destroy our way of life. They're 
			not the first to try, and their fate will be the same as those who 
			tried before. Nine-Eleven showed us why. The attacks were meant to 
			bring us to our knees, and they did, but not in the way the 
			terrorists intended. Americans united in prayer, came to the aid of 
			neighbors in need, and resolved that our enemies would not have the 
			last word. The spirit of our people is the source of America's 
			strength. And we go forward with trust in that spirit, confidence in 
			our purpose, and faith in a loving God who made us to be free.Thank you, and may God bless you.",sh address nation nation anniversary september require flash audioclick pdfgood even five year ago

for pdfPresident 
			Bush:Good afternoon, 
			and welcome to the White House. Earlier today I announced my intent 
			to nominate Robert Gates to be the next Secretary of the Defense. 
			And now I'm pleased to introduce him to the American people. I also 
			am looking forward to paying tribute to the man he will succeed.America remains a nation at 
			war. We face brutal enemies who despise our freedom and want to 
			destroy our way of life. These enemies attacked our country on 
			September the 11th, 2001; they fight us in Afghanistan and Iraq, and 
			they remain determined to attack our country again. Against such 
			enemies, there's only one way to protect the American people: We 
			must stay on the offense and bring our enemies to justice before 
			they hurt us again.In this time of war, the President 
			relies on the Secretary of Defense to provide military advice and 
			direct our nation's Armed Forces as they engage our enemies across 
			the world. The Secretary of Defense must be a man of vision who can 
			see threats still over the horizon, and prepare our nation to meet 
			them. Bob Gates is the right man to meet both of these critical 
			challenges.Bob is one of our nation's most 
			accomplished public servants. He joined the CIA in 1966, and has 
			nearly 27 years of national security experience, serving six 
			Presidents of both political parties. He spent nearly nine years 
			serving on the National Security Council staff. And at the CIA, he 
			rose from an entry-level employee to become the Director of the 
			Central Intelligence. And his experience has prepared him well for 
			this new assignment.Bob understands the challenges we 
			face in Afghanistan. As President Reagan's Deputy Director of 
			Central Intelligence, he helped lead America's efforts to drive 
			Soviet forces from Afghanistan. Success in these efforts weakened 
			the Soviet regime and helped hasten freedom's victory in the Cold 
			War.Bob understands the challenges facing 
			our nation in Iraq. He served as Deputy National Security Advisor to 
			the first President Bush during Operation Desert Storm as American 
			troops repelled Iraqi aggression and drove Saddam Hussein's forces 
			from Kuwait. More recently, he served as a member of the Iraq Study 
			Group, a distinguished independent panel of Republicans and 
			Democrats led by former Secretary of State Jim Baker and former 
			Congressman Lee Hamilton. As part of this commission, he has 
			traveled to Iraq and met with the country's leaders and our military 
			commanders on the ground. He'll provide the department with a fresh 
			perspective and new ideas on how America can achieve our goals in 
			Iraq.Bob understands how to lead large, 
			complex institutions and transform them to meet new challenges. As 
			Director of Central Intelligence, following the collapse of the 
			Soviet Union, he was responsible for leading all the foreign 
			intelligence agencies of the United States. And he's brought that 
			same leadership and abilities as his work as President of our 
			nation's sixth largest university, Texas A&M. When the A&M board of 
			regents interviewed him for the job, he described himself as an 
			agent of change. As president, he delivered on that promise, 
			initiating wide-ranging reforms to almost every aspect of campus 
			life. He'll bring that same transformational spirit to his work in 
			the Department of Defense.Bob Gates is a patriot whose 
			love for country was nurtured in the Kansas community where he was 
			raised. He's worn our nation's uniform. He's a strategic thinker who 
			was educated at three of America's finest universities, receiving 
			his bachelor's degree from William & Mary, a master's degree in 
			history from Indiana University, and a doctorate in Russian and 
			Soviet history from Georgetown.He's a leader in the business 
			community who served on the boards of several major corporations. 
			He's a man of integrity, candor and sound judgment. He knows that 
			the challenge of protecting our country is larger than any political 
			party, and he has a record of working with leaders of both sides of 
			the aisle to strengthen our national security. He has my confidence 
			and my trust, and he will be an outstanding Secretary of Defense.Bob follows in the footsteps of one 
			of America's most skilled and capable national security leaders, 
			Donald Rumsfeld. Don is the longest-serving member of my Cabinet, 
			and next month he will reach another milestone when he becomes the 
			longest-serving Secretary of Defense in the history of our nation. I 
			appreciate his willingness to continue serving until his successor 
			is in place, because in a time of war, our nation cannot be without 
			a strong and steady hand leading our Department of Defense.Don has served in times of great 
			consequence for our nation. Few will forget the image of Don 
			Rumsfeld as he helped rescue workers carry the victims from the 
			rubble of the Pentagon on September the 11th, 2001. In the weeks 
			that followed, he directed the effort to plan our nation's military 
			response to an unprecedented attack on our soil. Under his 
			leadership, U.S. and coalition forces launched one of the most 
			innovative military campaigns in the history of modern warfare, 
			driving the Taliban and its al Qaeda allies from power in a matter 
			of weeks.In 2003, on my orders, he led the 
			planning and execution of another historic military campaign, 
			Operation Iraqi Freedom, that drove Saddam Hussein from power and 
			helped the Iraqi people establish a constitutional democracy in the 
			heart of the Middle East. History will record that on Don Rumsfeld's 
			watch, the men and women of our military overthrew two terrorist 
			regimes, liberated some 50 million people, brought justice to the 
			terrorist Zarqawi and scores of senior al Qaeda operatives, and 
			helped stop new terrorist attacks on our people.America 
			is safer and the world is more secure because of the service and the 
			leadership of Donald Rumsfeld. As he led the Pentagon in an 
			unprecedented war, Don never took his eye off another vital 
			responsibility, preparing America for the threats that await us as 
			this new century unfolds. He developed a new defense strategy. He 
			established a new Northern Command to protect the homeland, a new 
			Joint Forces Command to focus on transformation, a new Strategic 
			Command to defend against long-range attack, and transformed the 
			U.S. Special Operations Command for the war on terror.He led our efforts to create a new 
			NATO Response Force that allows NATO to deploy rapidly anywhere in 
			the world. He undertook the most sweeping transformation of 
			America's global force posture since the end of World War II. He 
			revitalized America's efforts to develop and deploy ballistic 
			missile defenses, and led a comprehensive review of America's 
			nuclear forces that has allowed us to undertake dramatic reductions 
			in offensive nuclear weapons.Don's work in these areas did not 
			often make the headlines. But the reforms that he has set in motion 
			are historic, and they will enhance the security of the American 
			people for decades to come.Over the past six years, I've relied 
			on Don Rumsfeld's advice and counsel. I've come to know his 
			character and his integrity. As the Secretary of Defense, he has 
			been dedicated to his mission, loyal to his President, and devoted 
			to the courageous men and women of our Armed Forces.Don once famously said, ""There are 
			known knowns; there are known unknowns; and there are unknown 
			unknowns."" Well, Mr. Secretary, here is a known known: Your service 
			has made America stronger, and made America a safer nation. You will 
			be missed, and I wish you and Joyce all the best in the years to 
			come.Don Rumsfeld is a tough act to 
			follow. That's why I picked a man of Bob Gates's caliber to succeed 
			him. When confirmed by the Senate, Bob will bring talent, energy and 
			innovation to the Department of Defense. He'll work every day to 
			keep the American people safe and to make our nation more secure. 
			And he'll do a superb job as America's next Secretary of Defense.Bob, I appreciate you agreeing to 
			serve our nation again, and congratulations.Robert 
			Gates:Thank you, sir. Mr. President, thank you for this high 
			honor and for your confidence. And let me add my thanks to Secretary 
			Rumsfeld for his service.I entered public service 40 years ago 
			last August. President Bush will be the seventh President I have 
			served. I had not anticipated returning to government service, and 
			have never enjoyed any position more than being president of Texas 
			A&M University. However, the United States is at war, in Iraq and 
			Afghanistan. We're fighting against terrorism worldwide. And we face 
			other serious challenges to peace and our security. I believe the 
			outcome of these conflicts will shape our world for decades to come. 
			Because our long-term strategic interests and our national and 
			homeland security are at risk, because so many of America's sons and 
			daughters in our Armed Forces are in harm's way, I did not hesitate 
			when the President asked me to return to duty.If confirmed by the Senate, I will 
			serve with all my heart, and with gratitude to the President for 
			giving me the opportunity to do so.Secretary 
			Rumsfeld:Bob Gates, 
			my congratulations to you on this nomination. My very best wishes. 
			Look forward to working with you in the transition.Mr. President, thank you for your 
			kind words, and the wholly unexpected opportunity you provided me to 
			serve in the Department of Defense again these past years -- six 
			years. It's been quite a time. It recalls to mind the statement by 
			Winston Churchill, something to the effect that ""I have benefited 
			greatly from criticism, and at no time have I suffered a lack 
			thereof.""The great respect that I have for 
			your leadership, Mr. President, in this little understood, 
			unfamiliar war, the first war of the 21st century -- it is not 
			well-known, it was not well-understood, it is complex for people to 
			comprehend. And I know, with certainty, that over time the 
			contributions you've made will be recorded by history.I must say that it's been the highest 
			honor of my life to serve with the talented men and women of the 
			Department of Defense, the amazing men and women -- young men and 
			women in uniform. It's a privilege. And their patriotism, their 
			professionalism, their dedication is truly an inspiration. They have 
			my respect; they will remain in my prayers always.Thank you.",sh remark rumsfeld resignation gate nomination secretary rumsfeld resignation gate nominationdelivered november require flash audioyour

for pdfThank you very much. And tonight, I have a high 

privilege and distinct honor of my own -- as the first President to begin the 

State of the Union message with these words:Madam Speaker.In his day, the late Congressman Thomas 

D'Alesandro, Jr. from Baltimore, Maryland, saw Presidents Roosevelt and Truman 

at this rostrum. But nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter, 

Nancy, presiding tonight as Speaker of the House of Representatives. 

Congratulations, Madam Speaker.Two members of the House and Senate are not with 

us tonight, and we pray for the recovery and speedy return of Senator Tim 

Johnson and Congressman Charlie Norwood.Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of 

Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:The rite of custom brings us together at a 

defining hour -- when decisions are hard and courage is needed. We enter the 

year 2007 with large endeavors underway, and others that are ours to begin. In 

all of this, much is asked of us. We must have the will to face difficult 

challenges and determined enemies -- and the wisdom to face them together.Some in this chamber are new to the House and the 

Senate -- and I congratulate the Democrat majority. Congress has changed, but 

not our responsibilities. Each of us is guided by our own convictions -- and to 

these we must stay faithful. Yet we're all held to the same standards, and 

called to serve the same good purposes: To extend this nation's prosperity; to 

spend the people's money wisely; to solve problems, not leave them to future 

generations; to guard America against all evil; and to keep faith with those we 

have sent forth to defend us.We're not the first to come here with a 

government divided and uncertainty in the air. Like many before us, we can work 

through our differences, and achieve big things for the American people. Our 

citizens don't much care which side of the aisle we sit on -- as long as we're 

willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done. Our job is to make 

life better for our fellow Americans, and to help them to build a future of hope 

and opportunity -- and this is the business before us tonight.A future of hope and opportunity begins with a 

growing economy -- and that is what we have. We're now in the 41st month of 

uninterrupted job growth, in a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs -- 

so far. Unemployment is low, inflation is low, and wages are rising. This 

economy is on the move, and our job is to keep it that way, not with more 

government, but with more enterprise.Next week, I'll deliver a full report on the 

state of our economy. Tonight, I want to discuss three economic reforms that 

deserve to be priorities for this Congress.First, we must balance the federal budget. We can 

do so without raising taxes. What we need to do is impose spending discipline in 

Washington, D.C. We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009, and met 

that goal three years ahead of schedule. Now let us take the next step. In the 

coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the federal deficit within 

the next five years. I ask you to make the same commitment. Together, we can 

restrain the spending appetite of the federal government, and we can balance the 

federal budget.Next, there is the matter of earmarks. These 

special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour -- when not 

even C-SPAN is watching. In 2005 alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 

13,000 and totaled nearly $18 billion. Even worse, over 90 percent of earmarks 

never make it to the floor of the House and Senate -- they are dropped into 

committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk. 

You didn't vote them into law. I didn't sign them into law. Yet, they're treated 

as if they have the force of law. The time has come to end this practice. So let 

us work together to reform the budget process, expose every earmark to the light 

of day and to a vote in Congress, and cut the number and cost of earmarks at 

least in half by the end of this session.And, finally, to keep this economy strong we must 

take on the challenge of entitlements. Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid 

are commitments of conscience, and so it is our duty to keep them permanently 

sound. Yet, we're failing in that duty. And this failure will one day leave our 

children with three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and 

immediate cuts in benefits. Everyone in this chamber knows this to be true -- 

yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act. So let us work together 

and do it now. With enough good sense and goodwill, you and I can fix Medicare 

and Medicaid -- and save Social Security.Spreading opportunity and hope in America also 

requires public schools that give children the knowledge and character they need 

in life. Five years ago, we rose above partisan differences to pass the No Child 

Left Behind Act, preserving local control, raising standards, and holding those 

schools accountable for results. And because we acted, students are performing 

better in reading and math, and minority students are closing the achievement 

gap.Now the task is to build on the success, without watering down standards, 

without taking control from local communities, and without backsliding and 

calling it reform. We can lift student achievement even higher by giving local 

leaders flexibility to turn around failing schools, and by giving families with 

children stuck in failing schools the right to choose someplace better. We must 

increase funds for students who struggle -- and make sure these children get the 

special help they need. And we can make sure our children are prepared for the 

jobs of the future and our country is more competitive by strengthening math and 

science skills. The No Child Left Behind Act has worked for America's children 

-- and I ask Congress to reauthorize this good law.A future of hope and opportunity requires that 

all our citizens have affordable and available health care. When it comes to 

health care, government has an obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled, 

and poor children. And we will meet those responsibilities. For all other 

Americans, private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs. But 

many Americans cannot afford a health insurance policy.And so tonight, I propose two new initiatives to 

help more Americans afford their own insurance. First, I propose a standard tax 

deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for 

dependents. Families with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax -- 

or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income. Single Americans with health 

insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $7,500 of their income. With 

this reform, more than 100 million men, women, and children who are now covered 

by employer-provided insurance will benefit from lower tax bills. At the same 

time, this reform will level the playing field for those who do not get health 

insurance through their job. For Americans who now purchase health insurance on 

their own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings -- $4,500 for a 

family of four making $60,000 a year. And for the millions of other Americans 

who have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put a basic 

private health insurance plan within their reach. Changing the tax code is a 

vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans.My second proposal is to help the states that are 

coming up with innovative ways to cover the uninsured. States that make basic 

private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive federal 

funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick. I have asked 

the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with Congress to take 

existing federal funds and use them to create ""Affordable Choices"" grants. These 

grants would give our nation's governors more money and more flexibility to get 

private health insurance to those most in need.There are many other ways that Congress can help. 

We need to expand Health Savings Accounts. We need to help small businesses 

through Association Health Plans. We need to reduce costs and medical errors 

with better information technology. We will encourage price transparency. And to 

protect good doctors from junk lawsuits, we passing medical liability reform. In 

all we do, we must remember that the best health care decisions are made not by 

government and insurance companies, but by patients and their doctors.Extending hope and opportunity in our country 

requires an immigration system worthy of America -- with laws that are fair and 

borders that are secure. When laws and borders are routinely violated, this 

harms the interests of our country. To secure our border, we're doubling the 

size of the Border Patrol, and funding new infrastructure and technology.Yet even with all these steps, we cannot fully 

secure the border unless we take pressure off the border -- and that requires a 

temporary worker program. We should establish a legal and orderly path for 

foreign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis. As a result, 

they won't have to try to sneak in, and that will leave Border Agents free to 

chase down drug smugglers and criminals and terrorists. We'll enforce our 

immigration laws at the work site and give employers the tools to verify the 

legal status of their workers, so there's no excuse left for violating the law.We need to uphold the great tradition of the 

melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals. We need to resolve the 

status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without 

animosity and without amnesty. Convictions run deep in this Capitol when it 

comes to immigration. Let us have a serious, civil, and conclusive debate, so 

that you can pass, and I can sign, comprehensive immigration reform into law.Extending hope and opportunity depends on a 

stable supply of energy that keeps America's economy running and America's 

environment clean. For too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil. 

And this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes, and to 

terrorists -- who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments, and raise the 

price of oil, and do great harm to our economy.It's in our vital interest to diversify America's 

energy supply -- the way forward is through technology. We must continue 

changing the way America generates electric power, by even greater use of clean 

coal technology, solar and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power. We need 

to press on with battery research for plug-in and hybrid vehicles, and expand 

the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel. We must continue investing 

in new methods of producing ethanol -- using everything from wood chips to 

grasses, to agricultural wastes.We made a lot of progress, thanks to good 

policies here in Washington and the strong response of the market. And now even 

more dramatic advances are within reach. Tonight, I ask Congress to join me in 

pursuing a great goal. Let us build on the work we've done and reduce gasoline 

usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next 10 years. When we do that 

we will have cut our total imports by the equivalent of three-quarters of all 

the oil we now import from the Middle East.To reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels, by setting 

a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and 

alternative fuels in 2017 -- and that is nearly five times the current target. 

At the same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for 

cars the way we did for light trucks -- and conserve up to 8.5 billion more 

gallons of gasoline by 2017.Achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically 

reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but it's not going to eliminate it. And so 

as we continue to diversify our fuel supply, we must step up domestic oil 

production in environmentally sensitive ways. And to further protect America 

against severe disruptions to our oil supply, I ask Congress to double the 

current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.America is on the verge of technological 

breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil. And 

these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment, and they 

will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change.A future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, 

impartial system of justice. The lives of our citizens across our nation are 

affected by the outcome of cases pending in our federal courts. We have a shared 

obligation to ensure that the federal courts have enough judges to hear those 

cases and deliver timely rulings. As President, I have a duty to nominate 

qualified men and women to vacancies on the federal bench. And the United States 

Senate has a duty, as well, to give those nominees a fair hearing, and a prompt 

up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.For all of us in this room, there is no higher 

responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger. Five 

years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the 

terrorists can cause. We've had time to take stock of our situation. We've added 

many critical protections to guard the homeland. We know with certainty that the 

horrors of that September morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists 

intend for us -- unless we stop them.With the distance of time, we find ourselves 

debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed. Such debates 

are essential when a great democracy faces great questions. Yet one question has 

surely been settled: that to win the war on terror we must take the fight to the 

enemy.From the start, America and our allies have 

protected our people by staying on the offense. The enemy knows that the days of 

comfortable sanctuary, easy movement, steady financing, and free flowing 

communications are long over. For the terrorists, life since 9/11 has never been 

the same.Our success in this war is often measured by the 

things that did not happen. We cannot know the full extent of the attacks that 

we and our allies have prevented, but here is some of what we do know: We 

stopped an al Qaeda plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building on 

the West Coast. We broke up a Southeast Asian terror cell grooming operatives 

for attacks inside the United States. We uncovered an al Qaeda cell developing 

anthrax to be used in attacks against America. And just last August, British 

authorities uncovered a plot to blow up passenger planes bound for America over 

the Atlantic Ocean. For each life saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave 

public servants who devote their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping 

them.Every success against the terrorists is a 

reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy. The evil that inspired and 

rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the world. And so long as that's the case, 

America is still a nation at war.In the mind of the terrorist, this war began well 

before September the 11th, and will not end until their radical vision is 

fulfilled. And these past five years have given us a much clearer view of the 

nature of this enemy. Al Qaeda and its followers are Sunni extremists, possessed 

by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology. Take almost any 

principle of civilization, and their goal is the opposite. They preach with 

threats, instruct with bullets and bombs, and promise paradise for the murder of 

the innocent.Our enemies are quite explicit about their 

intentions. They want to overthrow moderate governments, and establish safe 

havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country. By killing 

and terrorizing Americans, they want to force our country to retreat from the 

world and abandon the cause of liberty. They would then be free to impose their 

will and spread their totalitarian ideology. Listen to this warning from the 

late terrorist Zarqawi: ""We will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to 

your dreams, and what is coming is even worse."" Osama bin Laden declared: ""Death 

is better than living on this Earth with the unbelievers among us.""These men are not given to idle words, and they 

are just one camp in the Islamist radical movement. In recent times, it has also 

become clear that we face an escalating danger from Shia extremists who are just 

as hostile to America, and are also determined to dominate the Middle East. Many 

are known to take direction from the regime in Iran, which is funding and arming 

terrorists like Hezbollah -- a group second only to al Qaeda in the American 

lives it has taken.The Shia and Sunni extremists are different faces 

of the same totalitarian threat. Whatever slogans they chant, when they 

slaughter the innocent they have the same wicked purposes. They want to kill 

Americans, kill democracy in the Middle East, and gain the weapons to kill on an 

even more horrific scale.In the sixth year since our nation was attacked, 

I wish I could report to you that the dangers had ended. They have not. And so 

it remains the policy of this government to use every lawful and proper tool of 

intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do our duty, to 

find these enemies, and to protect the American people.This war is more than a clash of arms -- it is a 

decisive ideological struggle, and the security of our nation is in the balance. 

To prevail, we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred, and drove 

19 men to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us. What every terrorist fears 

most is human freedom -- societies where men and women make their own 

choices, answer to their own conscience, and live by their hopes instead of 

their resentments. Free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies 

-- and most will choose a better way when they're given a chance. So we advance 

our own security interests by helping moderates and reformers and brave voices 

for democracy. The great question of our day is whether America will help men 

and women in the Middle East to build free societies and share in the rights of 

all humanity. And I say, for the sake of our own security, we must.In the last two years, we've seen the desire for 

liberty in the broader Middle East -- and we have been sobered by the enemy's 

fierce reaction. In 2005, the world watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised 

the banner of the Cedar Revolution, they drove out the Syrian occupiers and 

chose new leaders in free elections. In 2005, the people of Afghanistan defied 

the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature. And in 2005, the Iraqi 

people held three national elections, choosing a transitional government, 

adopting the most progressive, democratic constitution in the Arab world, and 

then electing a government under that constitution. Despite endless threats from 

the killers in their midst, nearly 12 million Iraqi citizens came out to vote in 

a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget.A thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, 

adjusted their tactics, and in 2006 they struck back. In Lebanon, assassins took 

the life of Pierre Gemayel, a prominent participant in the Cedar Revolution. 

Hezbollah terrorists, with support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict in the 

region and are seeking to undermine Lebanon's legitimately elected government. 

In Afghanistan, Taliban and al Qaeda fighters tried to regain power by 

regrouping and engaging Afghan and NATO forces. In Iraq, al Qaeda and other 

Sunni extremists blew up one of the most sacred places in Shia Islam -- the 

Golden Mosque of Samarra. This atrocity, directed at a Muslim house of prayer, 

was designed to provoke retaliation from Iraqi Shia -- and it succeeded. Radical 

Shia elements, some of whom receive support from Iran, formed death squads. The 

result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to 

this day.This is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it 

is the fight we're in. Every one of us wishes this war were over and won. Yet it 

would not be like us to leave our promises unkept, our friends abandoned, and 

our own security at risk. Ladies and gentlemen: On this day, at this hour, it is 

still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle. Let us find our 

resolve, and turn events toward victory.We're carrying out a new strategy in Iraq -- a 

plan that demands more from Iraq's elected government, and gives our forces in 

Iraq the reinforcements they need to complete their mission. Our goal is a 

democratic Iraq that upholds the rule of law, respects the rights of its people, 

provides them security, and is an ally in the war on terror.In order to make progress toward this goal, the 

Iraqi government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital. But the Iraqis 

are not yet ready to do this on their own. So we're deploying reinforcements of 

more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq. The vast majority will 

go to Baghdad, where they will help Iraqi forces to clear and secure 

neighborhoods, and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army units. With Iraqis 

in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the 

terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming death squads. And in Anbar Province, 

where al Qaeda terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a 

willingness to fight them, we're sending an additional 4,000 United States 

Marines, with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out. We didn't drive 

al Qaeda out of their safe haven in Afghanistan only to let them set up a new 

safe haven in a free Iraq.The people of Iraq want to live in peace, and now 

it's time for their government to act. Iraq's leaders know that our commitment 

is not open-ended. They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to 

secure Baghdad -- and they must do so. They pledged that they will confront 

violent radicals of any faction or political party -- and they need to follow 

through, and lift needless restrictions on Iraqi and coalition forces, so these 

troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of the people of 

Baghdad. Iraq's leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks -- 

to achieve reconciliation, to share oil revenues among all of Iraq's citizens, 

to put the wealth of Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq, to allow more Iraqis to 

re-enter their nation's civic life, to hold local elections, and to take 

responsibility for security in every Iraqi province. But for all of this to 

happen, Baghdad must be secure. And our plan will help the Iraqi government take 

back its capital and make good on its commitments.My fellow citizens, our military commanders and I 

have carefully weighed the options. We discussed every possible approach. In the 

end, I chose this course of action because it provides the best chance for 

success. Many in this chamber understand that America must not fail in Iraq, 

because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and 

far-reaching.If American forces step back before Baghdad is 

secure, the Iraqi government would be overrun by extremists on all sides. We 

could expect an epic battle between Shia extremists backed by Iran, and Sunni 

extremists aided by al Qaeda and supporters of the old regime. A contagion of 

violence could spill out across the country -- and in time, the entire region 

could be drawn into the conflict.For America, this is a nightmare scenario. For 

the enemy, this is the objective. Chaos is the greatest ally -- their greatest 

ally in this struggle. And out of chaos in Iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy 

with new safe havens, new recruits, new resources, and an even greater 

determination to harm America. To allow this to happen would be to ignore the 

lessons of September the 11th and invite tragedy. Ladies and gentlemen, nothing 

is more important at this moment in our history than for America to succeed in 

the Middle East, to succeed in Iraq and to spare the American people from this 

danger.This is where matters stand tonight, in the here 

and now. I have spoken with many of you in person. I respect you and the 

arguments you've made. We went into this largely united, in our assumptions and 

in our convictions. And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure. 

Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give it a 

chance to work. And I ask you to support our troops in the field, and those on 

their way.The war on terror we fight today is a 

generational struggle that will continue long after you and I have turned our 

duties over to others. And that's why it's important to work together so our 

nation can see this great effort through. Both parties and both branches should 

work in close consultation. It's why I propose to establish a special advisory 

council on the war on terror, made up of leaders in Congress from both political 

parties. We will share ideas for how to position America to meet every challenge 

that confronts us. We'll show our enemies abroad that we are united in the goal 

of victory.And one of the first steps we can take together 

is to add to the ranks of our military so that the American Armed Forces are 

ready for all the challenges ahead. Tonight I ask the Congress to authorize an 

increase in the size of our active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 in the next 

five years. A second task we can take on together is to design and establish a 

volunteer Civilian Reserve Corps. Such a corps would function much like our 

military reserve. It would ease the burden on the Armed Forces by allowing us to 

hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when America 

needs them. It would give people across America who do not wear the uniform a 

chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time.Americans can have confidence in the outcome of 

this struggle because we're not in this struggle alone. We have a diplomatic 

strategy that is rallying the world to join in the fight against extremism. In 

Iraq, multinational forces are operating under a mandate from the United 

Nations. We're working with Jordan and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and the Gulf 

States to increase support for Iraq's government.The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran, 

and made it clear that the world will not allow the regime in Tehran to acquire 

nuclear weapons. With the other members of the Quartet -- the U.N., the European 

Union, and Russia -- we're pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the Holy 

Land, and pursuing the establishment of a democratic Palestinian state living 

side-by-side with Israel in peace and security. In Afghanistan, NATO has taken 

the lead in turning back the Taliban and al Qaeda offensive -- the first time 

the Alliance has deployed forces outside the North Atlantic area. Together with 

our partners in China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea, we're pursuing intensive 

diplomacy to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons.We will continue to speak out for the cause of 

freedom in places like Cuba, Belarus, and Burma -- and continue to awaken the 

conscience of the world to save the people of Darfur.American foreign policy is more than a matter of 

war and diplomacy. Our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: To 

whom much is given, much is required. We hear the call to take on the challenges 

of hunger and poverty and disease -- and that is precisely what America is 

doing. We must continue to fight HIV/AIDS, especially on the continent of 

Africa. Because you funded our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the number of 

people receiving life-saving drugs has grown from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in 

three short years. I ask you to continue funding our efforts to fight HIV/AIDS. 

I ask you to provide $1.2 billion over five years so we can combat malaria in 15 

African countries.I ask that you fund the Millennium Challenge 

Account, so that American aid reaches the people who need it, in nations where 

democracy is on the rise and corruption is in retreat. And let us continue to 

support the expanded trade and debt relief that are the best hope for lifting 

lives and eliminating poverty.When America serves others in this way, we show 

the strength and generosity of our country. These deeds reflect the character of 

our people. The greatest strength we have is the heroic kindness, courage, and 

self-sacrifice of the American people. You see this spirit often if you know 

where to look -- and tonight we need only look above to the gallery.Dikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa, amid great 

poverty and disease. He came to Georgetown University on a scholarship to study 

medicine -- but Coach John Thompson got a look at Dikembe and had a different 

idea. Dikembe became a star in the NBA, and a citizen of the United States. But 

he never forgot the land of his birth, or the duty to share his blessings with 

others. He built a brand new hospital in his old hometown. A friend has said of 

this good-hearted man: ""Mutombo believes that God has given him this opportunity 

to do great things."" And we are proud to call this son of the Congo a citizen of 

the United States of America.After her daughter was born, Julie Aigner-Clark 

searched for ways to share her love of music and art with her child. So she 

borrowed some equipment, and began filming children's videos in her basement. 

The Baby Einstein Company was born, and in just five years her business grew to 

more than $20 million in sales. In November 2001, Julie sold Baby Einstein to 

the Walt Disney Company, and with her help Baby Einstein has grown into a $200 

million business. Julie represents the great enterprising spirit of America. And 

she is using her success to help others -- producing child safety videos with 

John Walsh of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Julie says 

of her new project: ""I believe it's the most important thing that I have ever 

done. I believe that children have the right to live in a world that is safe."" 

And so tonight, we are pleased to welcome this talented business entrepreneur 

and generous social entrepreneur -- Julie Aigner-Clark.Three weeks ago,Wesley Autreywas waiting at a 

Harlem subway station with his two little girls, when he saw a man fall into the 

path of a train. With seconds to act, Wesley jumped onto the tracks, pulled the 

man into the space between the rails, and held him as the train passed right 

above their heads. He insists he's not a hero. He says: ""We got guys and girls 

overseas dying for us to have our freedoms. We have got to show each other some 

love."" There is something wonderful about a country that produces a brave and 

humble man likeWesley Autrey.Tommy Rieman was a teenager pumping gas in 

Independence, Kentucky, when he enlisted in the United States Army. In December 

2003, he was on a reconnaissance mission in Iraq when his team came under heavy 

enemy fire. From his Humvee, Sergeant Rieman returned fire; he used his body as 

a shield to protect his gunner. He was shot in the chest and arm, and received 

shrapnel wounds to his legs -- yet he refused medical attention, and stayed in 

the fight. He helped to repel a second attack, firing grenades at the enemy's 

position. For his exceptional courage, Sergeant Rieman was awarded the Silver 

Star. And like so many other Americans who have volunteered to defend us, he has 

earned the respect and the gratitude of our entire country.In such courage and compassion, ladies and 

gentlemen, we see the spirit and character of America -- and these qualities are 

not in short supply. This is a decent and honorable country -- and resilient, 

too. We've been through a lot together. We've met challenges and faced dangers, 

and we know that more lie ahead. Yet we can go forward with confidence -- 

because the State of our Union is strong, our cause in the world is right, and 

tonight that cause goes on. God bless.See you next year. Thank you for your prayers.Also in this database:2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,20082009,20102011201220132014201520162017State of the Union AddressesText, Audio, Images Source:

transcribed directly from audio. (2)]Governor, thank you. 
			President Steger, thank you very much. Students, and faculty, and 
			staff, and grieving family members, and members of this really 
			extraordinary place.Laura and I have come to 
			Blacksburg today with hearts full of sorrow. This is a day of 
			mourning for the Virginia Tech community -- and it is a day of 
			sadness for our entire nation. We've come to express our sympathy. 
			In this time of anguish, I hope you know that people all over this 
			country are thinking about you, and asking God to provide comfort 
			for all who have been affected.Yesterday began like any 
			other day. Students woke up, and they grabbed their backpacks and 
			they headed for class. And soon the day took a dark turn, with 
			students and faculty barricading themselves in classrooms and 
			dormitories -- confused, terrified, and deeply worried. By the end 
			of the morning, it was the worst day of violence on a college campus 
			in American history -- and for many of you here today, it was the 
			worst day of your lives.It's impossible to make 
			sense of such violence and suffering. Those whose lives were taken 
			did nothing to deserve their fate. They were simply in the wrong 
			place at the wrong time. Now they're gone -- and they leave behind 
			grieving families, and grieving classmates, and a grieving nation.In such times as this, 
			we look for sources of strength to sustain us. And in this moment of 
			loss, you're finding these sources everywhere around you. These 
			sources of strength are in this community, this college community. 
			You have a compassionate and resilient community here at Virginia 
			Tech. Even as yesterday's events were still unfolding, members of 
			this community found each other; you came together in dorm rooms and 
			dining halls and on blogs. One recent graduate wrote this:I don't know most of you guys, 
				but we're all Hokies, which means we're family. To all of you 
				who are okay, I'm happy for that. For those of you who are in 
				pain or have lost someone close to you, I'm sure you can call on 
				anyone of us and have help any time you need it.These sources of 
			strength are with your loved ones. For many of you, your first 
			instinct was to call home and let your moms and dads know that you 
			were okay. Others took on the terrible duty of calling the relatives 
			of a classmate or a colleague who had been wounded or lost. I know 
			many of you feel awfully far away from people you lean on, people 
			you count on during difficult times. But as a dad, I can assure you, 
			a parent's love is never far from their child's heart. And as you 
			draw closer to your own families in the coming days, I ask you to 
			reach out to those who ache for sons and daughters who will never 
			come home.These sources of 
			strength are also in the faith that sustains so many of us. Across 
			the town of Blacksburg and in towns all across America, houses of 
			worship from every faith have opened their doors and have lifted you 
			up in prayer. People who have never met you are praying for you; 
			they're praying for your friends who have fallen and who are 
			injured. There's a power in these prayers, real power. In times like 
			this, we can find comfort in the grace and guidance of a loving God. 
			As the Scriptures tells us, ""Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome 
			evil with good.""¹And on this terrible day 
			of mourning, it's hard to imagine that time will come when life at 
			Virginia Tech will return to normal. But such a day will come. And 
			when it does, you will always remember the friends and teachers who 
			were lost yesterday, and the time you shared with them, and the 
			lives they hoped to lead.May God bless you.May God bless and keep 
			the souls of the lost.And may His love touch all those who suffer 
			in grief.¹Romans 12:21(World English Bible)Please see:Virginia Tech Day of Remembrance,and""We Remember"" Memorial WebsiteSee also:Virginia Tech Memorial Ceremony and SpeechesAudio Source:

74,15 May 2008,>George W. Bush: Democracy Conference Speech at Prague's Czernin Palace,"Thank you, all. Thank you.[Estonian] President Ilves,Foreign Minister Schwarzenberg, 
distinguished guests:Laura and I are pleased to be back inPrague, and we 
appreciate the gracious welcome in thishistoric hall. Tomorrow I attend the G-8 
Summit, where I will meet with the leaders of the world's most powerful 
economies. This afternoon, I stand with men and women who represent an even 
greater power -- the power of human conscience.In this room are dissidents, democratic 
activists from 17 countries on five continents. You follow different traditions; 
you practice different faiths; and you face different challenges. But you're 
united by an unwavering conviction: that freedom is the non-negotiable right of 
every man, woman, and child; and that the path to lasting peace in our world is 
liberty.This conferencewas conceived by three of the 
great advocates for freedom in our time:Jose Maria Aznar,Vaclav Havel, andNatan Sharansky. I thank them for the invitation to address this inspiring 
assembly, and for showing the world that an individual with moral clarity and 
courage can change the course of history.It is fitting that we meet in theCzech Republic-- a nation at the heart of Europe, and of the struggle for freedom on this 
continent. Nine decades ago,Tomas Masarykproclaimed Czechoslovakia's 
independence based on the ""ideals of modern democracy."" That democracy was 
interrupted, first by the Nazis, then by the communists, who seized power in 
a shameful coup that left theForeign Minister deadin the courtyard of this 
palace.Through the long darkness of the Soviet occupation, 
the true face of this nation was never in doubt. The world saw it in the reforms 
of thePrague Springand the principled demands ofCharter 77. Those efforts 
were met with tanks and truncheons and arrests by secret police. But the violent 
would not have the final wo[rd].Mass solidarity gathering at Wenceslas 
		Square in Prague, 1989. By Jů (cs:Jů) - This file is an electronic 
		scan of a film (photochemical) photograph made by Jů.film No.: 159,

		scanned from a negative by Foto-graf,CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=14684594In 1989, thousands gathered inWenceslas Squareto call for their freedom. Theaters like Magic[Magician's] Lanternbecame headquarters 
for dissidents. Workers left their factories to support a strike. Within 
weeks, the regime crumbled. Vaclav Havel went from prisoner of state to head of 
state. And the people of Czechoslovakia brought down the Iron Curtain with aVelvet Revolution.Across Europe, similar scenes were unfolding. In 
Poland, a movement that began in a single shipyard freed people across a nation. 
In Hungary, mourners gathered atHeroes' Squareto bury a slain reformer 
-- reformer -- and 
bury their communist regime, as well. In East Germany, families came together for 
prayer meetings -- and found the strength totear down a wall. Soon, activists 
emerged from the attics and church basements to reclaim the streets of Bulgaria, 
and Romania, and Albania; andLatvia, and Lithuania, and Estonia. TheWarsaw 
Pactwasdissolved peacefullyin this very room. And after seven decades of 
oppression, theSoviet Union ceased to exist.Behind these outstanding achievements was the 
triumph of freedom in the battle of ideas. The communists had an imperial 
ideology that claimed to know the directions of history. But in the end, it was 
overpowered by ordinary people who wanted to live their lives and worship their 
God and speak the truth to their children. The communists had the harsh rule of 
Brezhnev, and Honecker, and Ceausescu. But in the end, it was no match for the 
vision of Walesa and Havel, the defiance of Sakharov and Sharansky, the resolve 
of Reagan and Thatcher, and fearless witness of [Pope] John Paul. From this experience, 
a clear lesson has emerged: Freedom can be resisted, and freedom can be delayed, 
but freedom cannot be denied.In the years since liberation, Central and Eastern 
European nations have navigated the difficult transition to democracy. Leaders 
made the tough reforms needed to enter NATO and the European Union. Citizens 
claimed their freedom in the Balkans and beyond. And now, after centuries of war 
and suffering, the continent of Europe is at last in peace.With this new era have come new threats to 
freedom. In dark and repressive corners of the world, whole generations grew up 
with no voice in their government and no hope in their future. This life of 
oppression bred deep resentment. And for many, resentment boiled over into 
radicalism and extremism and violence. The world saw the result onSeptember the 
11th, 2001, when terrorists based in Afghanistan sent 19 suicidal men to murder 
nearly 3,000 innocent people in the United States.For some, this attack called for a narrow 
response. In truth, 9/11 was evidence of a much broader danger -- an 
international movement of violent Islamic extremists that threatens free peoples 
everywhere. The extremists' ambition is to build a totalitarian empire that 
spans all current and former Muslim lands, including parts of Europe. Their 
strategy to achieve that goal is to frighten the world into surrender through a 
ruthless campaign of terrorists' murder.To confront this enemy, America and our allies 
have taken the offensive with the full range of our military, intelligence, and 
law enforcement capabilities. Yet this battle is more than a military conflict. 
Like the Cold War, it's an ideological struggle between two fundamentally 
different visions of humanity. On one side are the extremists, who promise 
paradise, but deliver a life of public beatings and repression of women and 
suicide bombings. On the other side are huge numbers of moderate men and women 
-- including millions in the Muslim world -- who believe that every human life 
has dignity and value that no power on Earth can take away.The most powerful weapon in the struggle against 
extremism is not bullets or bombs. It is the universal appeal of freedom. 
Freedom is the design of our Maker, and the longing of every soul. Freedom is 
the best way to unleash the creativity and economic potential of a nation. 
Freedom is the only ordering of a society that leads to justice. And human 
freedom is the only way to achieve human rights.Expanding freedom is more than a moral imperative 
-- it is the only realistic way to protect our people in the long run. Years 
ago,Andrei Sakharovwarnedthat a ""country that does not respect the rights of 
its own people will not respond to the rights of its neighbors.""1History proves 
him right. Governments accountable to their people do not attack each other. 
Democracies address problems through the political process, instead of blaming 
outside scapegoats. Young people who can disagree openly with their leaders are 
less likely to adopt violent ideologies. And nations that commit to freedom for 
their people will not support extremists -- they will join in defeating them.For all these reasons, the United States is 
firmly committed to the advance of freedom and democracy as the great alternatives to 
repression and radicalism. We have a historic objective in view. In mySecond Inaugural Address, I pledged America to the ultimate goal of ending 
tyranny in our world.2Some have said that qualifies me as a ""dissident 
President."" If standing for liberty in the world makes me a dissident, I wear 
that title with pride.America pursues our freedom agenda in many ways -- 
some vocal and visible, others quiet and hidden from view. Ending tyranny 
requires support for the forces of conscience that undermine repressive 
societies from within. The Soviet dissidentAndrei Amalrikcompared a tyrannical 
state to a soldier who constantly points a gun at his enemy until his arms 
finally tire and the prisoner escapes. The role of the free world is to put 
pressure on the arms of the world's tyrants and strengthen the prisoners who 
are trying to speed their collapse.That's why I meet personally with dissidents and 
democratic activists from some of the world's worst dictatorships -- including 
Belarus, and Burma, and Cuba, and North Korea, Sudan, and Zimbabwe. At this 
conference, I look forward to meeting other dissidents, including some from Iran 
and Syria. One of those dissidents isMamoun [Al-]Homsi. In 2001, this man was an 
independent member of the Syrian parliament who simply issued a declaration 
asking the government to begin respecting human rights. For this entirely 
peaceful act, he was arrested and sent to jail, where he spent several years 
beside other innocent advocates for a free Syria.Another dissident I will meet here isRebiya 
Kadeerof China, whose sons have been jailed in what we believe is an act of 
retaliation for her human rights activities. The talent of men and women like 
Rebiya is the greatest resource of their nations, far more valuable than the 
weapons of their army or their oil under the ground. America calls on every 
nation that stifles dissent to end its repression, to trust its people, and to 
grant its citizens the freedom they deserve.There are many dissidents who couldn't join us 
because they are being unjustly imprisoned or held under house arrest. I look 
forward to the day when a conference like this one includesAlexander Kozulinof 
Belarus,Aung San Suu Kyiof Burma,Oscar Elias Biscetof Cuba,Father Nguyen 
Van Lyof Vietnam,Ayman Nourof Egypt. The daughter -- The 
daughter of one of these political 
prisoners is in this room. I would like to say to her, and all the families: I 
thank you for your courage. I pray for your comfort and strength. And I call for 
the immediate and unconditional release of your loved ones.In the eyes of America, the democratic dissidents 
today are the democratic leaders of tomorrow. So we're taking new steps to 
strengthen our support. We recently created a Human Rights Defenders Fund, which 
provides grants for the legal defense and medical expenses of activists arrested 
or beaten by repressive governments. I strongly support thePrague [Charter]that 
your conference plans to issue, which states that ""the protection of human 
rights is critical to international peace and security.""3And in keeping with the 
goals of that declaration, I have asked Secretary Rice to send a directive to 
every U.S. ambassador in an un-free nation: Seek out and meet with activists for 
democracy. Seek out those who demand human rights.People living in tyranny need to know they are not 
forgotten. North Koreans live in a closed society where dissent is brutally 
suppressed, and they are cut off from their brothers and sisters to the south. 
The Iranians are a great people who deserve to chart their own future, but they 
are denied their liberty by a handful of extremists whose pursuit of nuclear 
weapo prevents their country from taking its rightful place amongst the 
thriving. The Cubans are desperate for freedom -- and as that nation enters a 
period of transition, we must insist on free elections and free speech and free 
assembly.  And in Sudan -- And in Sudan, freedom is denied and basic human rights are 
violated by a government that pursues genocide against its own citizens.My 
message to all those who suffer under tyranny is this: We will never excuse your 
oppressors. We will always stand for your freedom.Freedom is also under assault in countries that 
have shown some progress. In Venezuela, elected leaders have resorted to shallow 
populism to dismantle democratic institutions and tighten their grip on power. 
The government of Uzbekistan continues to silence independent voices by jailing 
human rights activists. And Vietnam recently arrested and imprisoned a number of 
peaceful religious and political activists.These developments are discouraging, but there are 
more reasons for optimism. At the start of the 1980s, there were only 45 
democracies on Earth. There are now more than 120 democracies -- more people now 
live in freedom than ever before. And it is the responsibility of those who 
enjoy the blessings of liberty to help those who are struggling to establish 
their free societies. So the United States has nearly doubled funding for 
democracy projects. We're working with our partners in the G-8 to promote the 
rise of a vibrant civil society in the Middle East through initiatives like theForum for the Future. We're cooperating side-by-side with the new democracies in 
Ukraine and Georgia and Kyrgyzstan. We congratulate the people of Yemen on their 
landmark presidential election, and the people of Kuwait on elections in which 
women were able to vote and run for office for the first time. We stand firmly 
behind the people of Lebanon and Afghanistan and Iraq as they defend their 
democratic gains against extremist enemies. These people are making tremendous 
sacrifices for liberty. They deserve the admiration of the free world, and they 
deserve our unwavering support.The United States is also using our influence to 
urge valued partners like Egypt and Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to move toward 
freedom. These nations have taken brave st[a]nds and strong action to confront 
extremists, along with some steps to expand liberty and transparency. Yet they 
have a great distance still to travel. The United States will continue to press 
nations like these to open up their political systems, and give greater voice to 
their people. Inevitably, this creates tension. But our relationships with these 
countries are broad enough and deep enough to bear it. As our relationship[s] with 
South Korea and Taiwan during the Cold War prove, America can maintain a 
friendship and push a nation toward democracy at the same time.We're also applying that lesson to our 
relationships with Russia and China. The United States has strong working 
relationships with these countries. Our friendship with them is complex. In the 
areas where we share mutual interests, we work together. In other areas, we have 
strong disagreements. China's leaders believe that they can continue to open the 
nation's economy without opening its political system. We disagree. In Russia -- 
In Russia, reforms that were once promised to empower citizens have been derailed, with 
troubling implications for democratic development. Part of a good relationship 
is the ability to talk openly about our disagreements. So the United States will 
continue to build our relationships with these countries -- and we will do it 
without abandoning our principles or our values.We appreciate that free societies take shape at 
different speeds in different places. One virtue of democracy is that it 
reflects local history and traditions. Yet there are fundamental elements that 
all democracies share -- freedom of speech, religion, press, and assembly; rule 
of law enforced by independent courts; private property rights; and political 
parties that compete in free and fair elections.  These rights and 
institutions are the foundation of human dignity, and as countries find their 
own path to freedom, they must find a loyal partner in the United States of 
America.Extending the reach of freedom is a mission that 
unites democracies around the world. Some of the greatest contributions are 
coming from nations with the freshest memories of tyranny. I appreciate the 
Czech Republic's support for human rights projects in Belarus and Burma and 
Cuba. I thank Germany, and Poland, and the Czech Republic, and Hungary, and 
Slovenia, and Georgia, Lithuania, Estonia, Croatia for contributing to the...newUnited Nations Democracy Fund. I'm grateful for the commitment many new 
democracies in Central and Eastern Europe are making to Afghanistan and Iraq. I 
appreciate that these countries are willing to do the hard work necessary to 
enable people who want to be free to live in a free society.In all these ways, the freedom agenda is making a 
difference. The work has been difficult, and that is not going to change. There 
will be triumphs and failures, progress and setbacks. Ending tyranny cannot be 
achieved overnight. And of course, this objective has its critics.Some say that ending tyranny means ""imposing our 
values"" on people who do not share them, or that people live in parts of the 
world where freedom cannot take hold. That is refuted by the fact that every 
time people are given a choice, they choose freedom.We saw that when the people 
of Latin America turned dictatorships into democracies; when the people of South 
Africareplaced apartheidwith a free society; and the people of Indonesiaended 
their long authoritarian rule. We saw it whenUkrainians in orangescarves 
demanded that their ballots be counted. We saw it when millions of Afghans and 
Iraqis defied the terrorists to elect free governments. At a polling station in 
Baghdad, I was struck by the words of an Iraqi -- he had one leg -- and he told 
a reporter, ""I would have crawled here if I had to.""4When 
democracy -- Was democracy -- I ask -- I ask the 
critics, was democracy imposed on that man? Was freedom a value he did not 
share? The truth is that the only ones who have to impose their values are the 
extremists and the radicals and the tyrants.And that is why the communists crushed the Prague 
Spring, and threw an innocentplaywrightin jail, and trembled at the sight of aPolish Pope. History shows that, ultimately, freedom conquers fear. And given a 
chance, freedom will conquer fear in every nation on Earth.Another objective -- objection is that ending 
tyranny will unleash chaos. Critics point to the violence in Afghanistan, or 
Iraq, or Lebanon as evidence that freedom leaves people less safe. But look 
who's causing the violence: It's the terrorists; it's the extremists. It is no 
coincidence that they are targeting young democracies in the Middle East. They 
know that the success of free societies there is a mortal threat to their 
ambitions -- and to their very survival. The fact that our enemies are fighting 
back is not a reason to doubt democracy. It is evidence that they recognize 
democracy's power. It is evidence that we are at war. And it is evidence that 
free nations must do what it takes to prevail.Still, some argue that a safer goal would be 
stability, especially in the Middle East. The problem is that pursuing stability 
at the expense of liberty does not lead to peace -- it leads to September the 
11th, 2001.  The policy of tolerating tyranny is a moral and strategic 
failure. It is the mistake the world must not repeat in the 21st century.Others fear that democracy will bring dangerous 
forces to power, such asHamasin the Palestinian Territories. Elections will 
not always turn out the way we hope. Yet democracy consists of more than a 
single trip to the ballot box. Democracy requires meaningful opposition parties, 
a -- a vibrant civil society, a government that enforces the law and responds to the 
needs of its people. Elections can accelerate the creation of such institutions. 
In a democracy, people will not vote for a life of perpetual violence. To stay 
in power, elected officials must listen to their people and pursue their desires 
for peace -- or, in democracies, the voters will replace them through free 
elections.Finally, there's the contention that ending 
tyranny is unrealistic. Well, some argue that extending democracy around the 
world is simply too difficult to achieve. That's nothing new. We've heard that 
criticism before throughout history. At every stage of the Cold War, there were 
those who argued thatthe Berlin Wall was permanent, and that people behind the 
Iron Curtain would never overcome their oppressors.History has sent a different 
message.The lesson is that freedom will always have its 
skeptics. But that's not the whole story. There are also people like you, and 
the loved ones you represent -- men and women with courage to risk everything 
for your ideals. In hisfirst address as President, Vaclav Havel proclaimed, 
""People, your government has returned to you!"" He was echoing the first speech 
of Tomas Masaryk -- who was, in turn, quoting the 17th century Czech teacherComenius. His message was that freedom is 
timeless. It does not belong to one government or one generation. Freedom is the 
dream and the right of every person in every nation in every age.The United States of America believes deeply in 
that message. It was the inspiration for our Founding, when we declared that 
""all men are created equal."" It was the conviction that led us to help liberate 
this continent, and stand with the captive nations through their long struggle. 
It is the truth that guides our nation to oppose radicals and extremists and 
terror and tyranny in the world today. And it is the reason I have such great 
confidence in the men and women in this room.I leave Prague with a certainty that the cause of 
freedom is not tired, and that its future is in the best of hands. With 
unbreakable faith in the power of liberty, you will inspire your people. You 
will lead your nations. And you will change the world.Thanks for having me. And may God bless you.",thank thank estonian president ilves foreign minister schwarzenberg distinguish guest laura please back inprague appreciate gracious welcome thishistoric hall tomorrow attend

75,18 May 2008,>George W. Bush - United Nations General Assembly 2007 Speech (text-audio-vide,"General Assembly 2007 Speech (text-audio-video)GeorgeW.Bush2007 United Nations General Assembly Speechdelivered 25 
September 2007, New York, NYYour  browser does not support the video tag.Audio mp3 of AddressYour browser does not support the audio element.Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, 
distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen: Thank you for the opportunity to 
address the General Assembly of the United Nations.Sixty years ago, representatives from 16 nations gathered to begin deliberations 
on a new international bill of rights. The document they produced is called theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights-- and it stands as a landmark achievement 
in the history of human liberty. It opens by recognizing ""the inherent dignity"" 
and the ""equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family"" as 
""the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world."" And as we gather 
for this 62nd General Assembly, the standards of the Declaration must guide our 
work in this world.Achieving the promise of the Declaration requires confronting long-term threats; 
it also requires answering the immediate needs of today. The nations in this 
chamber have our differences, yet there are some areas where we can all agree. 
When innocent people are trapped in a life of murder and fear, the Declaration 
is not being upheld. When millions of children starve to death or perish from a 
mosquito bite, we're not doing our duty in the world. When whole societies are 
cut off from the prosperity of the global economy, we're all worse off. Changing 
these underlying conditions is what the Declaration calls the work of ""larger 
freedom"" -- and it must be the work of every nation in this assembly.This great institution must work for great 
purposes -- to free people from tyranny and violence, hunger and disease, 
illiteracy and ignorance, and poverty and despair. Every member of the United 
Nations must join in this mission of liberation.First, the mission of the United Nations requires 
liberating people from tyranny and violence. The first article of the Universal 
Declaration begins, ""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and 
rights."" The truth is denied by terrorists and extremists who kill the innocent 
with the aim of imposing their hateful vision on humanity. The followers of this 
violent ideology are a threat to civilized people everywhere. All civilized 
nations must work together to stop them -- by sharing intelligence about their 
networks, and choking their -- off their finances, and bringing to justice their 
operatives.In the long run, the best way to defeat extremists 
is to defeat their dark ideology with a more hopeful vision -- the vision of 
liberty that founded this body. The United States salutes the nations that have 
recently taken strides toward liberty -- including Ukraine and Georgia and 
Kyrgyzstan and Mauritania and Liberia, Sierra Leone and Morocco. The Palestinian 
Territories have moderate leaders, mainstream leaders that are working to build 
free institutions that fight terror, and enforce the law, and respond to the 
needs of their people. The international community must support these leaders, 
so that we can advance the vision of two democratic states, Israel and 
Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and security.Brave citizens in Lebanon and Afghanistan and Iraq 
have made the choice for democracy -- yet the extremists have responded by 
targeting them for murder. This is not a show of strength -- it is evidence of 
fear. And the extremists are doing everything in their power to bring down these 
young democracies. The people of Lebanon and Afghanistan and Iraq have asked for 
our help. And every civilized nation has a responsibility to stand with them.Every civilized nation also has a responsibility 
to stand up for the people suffering under dictatorship. In Belarus, North 
Korea, Syria, and Iran, brutal regimes deny their people the fundamental rights 
enshrined in the Universal Declaration. Americans are outraged by the situation 
in Burma, where a military junta has imposed a 19-year reign of fear. Basic 
freedoms of speech, assembly, and worship are severely restricted. Ethnic 
minorities are persecuted.Forced child labor, human trafficking, and rape 
are common. The regime is holding more than 1,000 political prisoners -- 
including Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party was elected overwhelmingly by the 
Burmese people in 1990.The ruling junta remains unyielding, yet the people's desire for freedom is 
unmistakable. This morning, I'm announcing a series of steps to help bring 
peaceful change to Burma. The United States will tighten economic sanctions on 
the leaders of the regime and their financial backers. We will impose an 
expanded visa ban on those responsible for the most egregious violations of 
human rights, as well as their family members. We'll continue to support the 
efforts of humanitarian groups working to alleviate suffering in Burma. And I 
urge the United Nations and all nations to use their diplomatic and economic 
leverage to help the Burmese people reclaim their freedom.In Cuba, the long rule of a cruel dictator is 
nearing its end. The Cuban people are ready for their freedom. And as that 
nation enters a period of transition, the United Nations must insist on free 
speech, free assembly, and ultimately, free and competitive elections.In Zimbabwe, ordinary citizens suffer under a 
tyrannical regime. The government has cracked down on peaceful calls for reform, 
and forced millions to flee their homeland. The behavior of the Mugabe regime is 
an assault on its people -- and an affront to the principles of the Universal 
Declaration. The United Nations must insist on change in Harare -- and must 
insist for the freedom of the people of Zimbabwe.In Sudan, innocent civilians are suffering 
repression -- and in the Darfur region, many are losing their lives to genocide. 
America has responded with tough sanctions against those responsible for the 
violence. We've provided more than $2 billion in humanitarian and peacekeeping 
aid. I look forward to attending a Security Council meeting that will focus on 
Darfur, chaired by the French President. I appreciate France's leadership in 
helping to stabilize Sudan's neighbors. And the United Nations must answer this 
challenge to conscience, and live up to its promise to promptly deploy 
peacekeeping forces to Darfur.Second, the mission of the United Nations requires 
liberating people from hunger and disease. Article 25 of the Universal 
Declaration states: ""Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for 
the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food and 
clothing and housing and medical care."" Around the world, the United Nations is 
carrying out noble efforts to live up to these words.Feeding the hungry has long been a special calling 
for my nation. Today, more than half the world's food assistance comes from 
America. We send emergency food stocks to starving people from camps in Sudan to 
slums in -- around the world. I've proposed an innovative initiative to 
alleviate hunger under which America would purchase the crops of local farmers 
in Africa and elsewhere, rather than shipping in food from the developed world. 
This would help build up local agriculture and break the cycle of famine in the 
developing world -- and I urge our United States Congress to support this 
initiative.Many in this hall are bringing the spirit of 
generosity to fighting HIV/AIDS and malaria. Five years ago, in Sub-Saharan 
Africa, an AIDS diagnosis was widely considered a death sentence, and fewer than 
50,000 people infected with the virus were receiving treatment. The world 
responded by creating the Global Fund, which is working with governments and the 
private sector to fight the disease around the world. The United States decided 
to take these steps a little further by launching the $15 billion Emergency Plan 
for AIDS Relief. Since 2003, this effort has helped bring cutting-edge medicines 
to more than a million people in sub-Sahara Africa. It's a good start. So 
earlier this year, I proposed to double our initial commitment to $30 billion. 
By coming together, the world can turn the tide against HIV/AIDS -- once and for 
all.Malaria is another common killer. In some 
countries, malaria takes as many lives as HIV/AIDS -- the vast majority of them 
children under the age of five years old. Every one of these deaths is 
unnecessary, because the disease is preventable and treatable. The world knows 
what it takes to stop malaria -- bed nets and indoor spraying and medicine to 
treat the disease. Two years ago, America launched a $1.2 billion malaria 
initiative. Other nations and the private sector are making vital contributions, 
as well. I call on every member state to maintain its focus, find new ways to 
join this cause, and bring us closer to the day when malaria deaths are no more.Third, the mission of the United Nations requires 
liberating people from the chains of illiteracy and ignorance. Article 26 of the 
Universal Declaration states: ""Everyone has the right to education."" And when 
nations make the investments needed to educate their people, the whole world 
benefits. Better education unleashes the talent and potential of its citizens, 
and adds to the prosperity of all of us. Better education promotes better health 
and greater independence. Better education increases the strength of democracy, 
and weakens the appeal of violent ideologies. So the United States is joining 
with nations around the world to help them provide a better education for their 
people.A good education starts with good teachers. In 
partnership with other nations, America has helped train more than 600,000 
teachers and administrators. A good education requires good textbooks. So in 
partnership with other nations, America has distributed tens of millions of 
textbooks. A good education requires access to good schools. So in partnership 
with other nations, America is helping nations raise standards in their schools 
at home, and providing scholarships to help students come to schools in the 
United States. In all our education efforts, our nation is working to expand 
access for women and girls, so that the opportunity to get a decent education is 
open to all.Finally, the mission of the United Nations 
requires liberating people from poverty and despair. Article 23 of the Universal 
Declaration states: ""Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of 
employment, [and] to just and favorable conditions of work."" In the 21st 
century, this requires ensuring that people in poor countries have the same 
opportunity to benefit from the global economy that citizens of wealthy 
countries have.The United Nations provides vital economic 
assistance designed to help developing nations grow their economies and reach 
their potential. The United States agrees with that position; we've dramatically 
increased our own development assistance -- and we're delivering that aid in 
innovative ways. We started the Millennium Challenge Account to reward nations 
that govern justly, fight corruption, invest in their people, and promote 
economic freedom. With this aid, we're reaching out to developing nations in 
partnership, not paternalism. And we're ensuring that our aid dollars reach 
those who need them -- and achieve results.In the long run, the best way to lift people out 
of poverty is through trade and investment. A nation that is open and trading 
with the world will create economic rewards that far exceed anything they could 
get through foreign aid. During the 1990s, developing nations that significantly 
lowered tariffs saw their per capita income grow about three times faster than 
other developing countries. Open markets ignite growth, encourage investment, 
increase transparency, strengthen the rule of law, and help countries help 
themselves.The international community now has an historic 
chance to open markets around the world by concluding a successful Doha Round of 
trade talks. A successful Doha outcome would mean real and substantial openings 
in agriculture, goods, and services -- and real and substantial reductions in 
trade-distorting subsidies. The world's largest trading nations, including major 
developing countries, have a special responsibility to make the tough political 
decisions to reduce trade barriers. America has the will and flexibility to make 
those necessary decisions. Our negotiators are demonstrating that spirit in 
Geneva. I urge other leaders to direct their negotiators to do the same. And I'm 
optimistic that we can reach a good Doha agreement -- and seize this 
once-in-a-generation opportunity.In the meantime, America will continue to pursue 
agreements that open trade and investment wherever we can. We recently signed 
free trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. These 
agreements embody the values of open markets -- transparent and fair regulation, 
respect for private property, and resolving disputes under international law 
rules. These are good agreements, and they're now ready for a congressional 
vote, and I urge the Congress to approve them as soon as possible.As America works with the United Nations to 
alleviate immediate needs, we're also coming together to address longer-term 
challenges. Together, we're preparing for pandemics that could cause death and 
suffering on a global scale. Together, we're working to stop the proliferation 
of weapons of mass destruction. Together, we're confronting the challenges of 
energy security, and environmental quality, and climate change. I appreciate the 
discussions on climate change led by the Secretary General last night. I look 
forward to further discussions at the meeting of major economies in Washington 
later this week.The goals I've outlined today cannot be achieved 
overnight -- and they cannot be achieved without reform in this vital 
institution. The United States is committed to a strong and vibrant United 
Nations. Yet the American people are disappointed by the failures of the Human 
Rights Council. This body has been silent on repression by regimes from Havana 
to Caracas to Pyongyang and Tehran -- while focusing its criticism excessively 
on Israel. To be credible on human rights in the world, the United Nations must 
reform its own Human Rights Council.Some have also called for reform to the structure 
of the Security Council, including an expansion of its membership. The United 
States is open to this prospect. We believe that Japan is well-qualified for 
permanent membership on the Security Council, and that other nations should be 
considered, as well. The United States will listen to all good ideas, and we 
will support changes to the Security Council as part of broader U.N. reform. And 
in all we do, I call on member states to work for an institution that adheres to 
strict ethical standards, and lives up to the high principles of the Universal 
Declaration.With the commitment and courage of this chamber, 
we can build a world where people are free to speak, assemble, and worship as 
they wish; a world where children in every nation grow up healthy, get a decent 
education, and look to the future with hope; a world where opportunity crosses 
every border. America will lead toward this vision where all are created equal, 
and free to pursue their dreams. This is the founding conviction of my country. 
It is the promise that established this body. And with our determination, it can 
be the future of our world.Thank you, and God bless.",general assembly speech unite nation general assembly speechdelivered september new york nyyour browser support video addressyour browser support

			Prime Minister Olmert, President Abbas, Secretary General Ban, 
			former Prime Minister Blair, distinguished guests: Welcome to one of 
			the finest institutes we have in America, the United States Naval 
			Academy. We appreciate you joining us in what I believe is an 
			historic opportunity to encourage the expansion of freedom and peace 
			in the Holy Land.We meet to lay the 
			foundation for the establishment of a new nation -- a democratic 
			Palestinian state that will live side by side with Israel in peace 
			and security. We meet to help bring an end to the violence that has 
			been the true enemy of the aspirations of both the Israelis and 
			Palestinians.We're off to a strong 
			start. I'm about to read a statement that was agreed upon by our 
			distinguished guests:The 
				representatives of the Government of the state of Israel and the 
				Palestinian Liberation Organization, represented respective by 
				Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, and President Mahmoud Abbas in his 
				capacity as Chairman of the PLO Executive Committee and 
				President of the Palestinian Authority, have convened in 
				Annapolis, Maryland, under the auspices of President George W. 
				Bush of the United States of America, and with the support of 
				the participants of this international conference, having 
				concluded the following joint understanding.We express our 
				determination to bring an end to bloodshed, suffering and 
				decades of conflict between our peoples; to usher in a new era 
				of peace, based on freedom, security, justice, dignity, respect 
				and mutual recognition; to propagate a culture of peace and 
				nonviolence; to confront terrorism and incitement, whether 
				committed by Palestinians or Israelis.In furtherance 
				of the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine living side by 
				side in peace and security:- We agree to 
				immediately launch good-faith bilateral negotiations in order to 
				conclude a peace treaty, resolving all outstanding issues, 
				including all core issues, without exception, as specified in 
				previous agreements.- We agree to 
				engage in vigorous, ongoing and continuous negotiations, and 
				shall make every effort to conclude an agreement before the end 
				of 2008.- For this 
				purpose, a steering committee, led jointly by the head of the 
				delegation of each party, will meet continuously, as agreed.- The steering 
				committee will develop a joint work plan and establish and 
				oversee the work of negotiations teams to address all issues, to 
				be headed by one lead representative from each party.- The first 
				session of the steering committee will be held on 12 December 
				2007.- President 
				Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert will continue to meet on a 
				bi-weekly basis to follow up the negotiations in order to offer 
				all necessary assistance for their advancement.The parties 
				also commit to immediately implement their respective 
				obligations under the performance-based road map to a permanent 
				two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, issued by 
				the Quartet on 30 April 2003 -- this is called the road map -- 
				and agree to form an American, Palestinian and Israeli 
				mechanism, led by the United States, to follow up on the 
				implementation of the road map. The parties further commit to 
				continue the implementation of the ongoing obligations of the 
				road map until they reach a peace treaty. The United States will 
				monitor and judge the fulfillment of the commitment of both 
				sides of the road map.Unless 
				otherwise agreed by the parties, implementation of the future 
				peace treaty will be subject to the implementation of the road 
				map, as judged by the United States.1Congratulations for 
			your strong leadership.The Palestinian people 
			are blessed with many gifts and talents. They want the opportunity 
			to use those gifts to better their own lives and build a better 
			future for their children. They want the dignity that comes with 
			sovereignty and independence. They want justice and equality under 
			the rule of law. They want freedom from violence and fear.The people of Israel 
			have just aspirations, as well. They want their children to be able 
			to ride a bus or to go to school without fear of suicide bombers. 
			They want an end to rocket attacks and constant threats of assault. 
			They want their nation to be recognized and welcomed in the region 
			where they live.Today, Palestinians 
			and Israelis each understand that helping the other to realize their 
			aspirations is key to realizing their own aspirations -- and both 
			require an independent, democratic, viable Palestinian state. Such a 
			state will provide Palestinians with the chance to lead lives of 
			freedom and purpose and dignity. Such a state will help provide the 
			Israelis with something they have been seeking for generations: to 
			live in peace with their neighbors.Achieving this goal is 
			not going to be easy -- if it were easy, it would have happened a 
			long time ago. To achieve freedom and peace, both Israelis and 
			Palestinians will have to make tough choices. Both sides are sober 
			about the work ahead, but having spent time with their leaders, they 
			are ready to take on the tough issues. As Prime Minister Olmert 
			recently put it, ""We will avoid none of [the historic questions], we 
			will not run from discussing any of them."" As President Abbas has 
			said: ""I believe that there is an opportunity not only for us but 
			for the Israelis, too. We have a historic and important opportunity 
			that we must benefit from."" It is with that spirit that we concluded 
			-- that they concluded this statement I just read.Our purpose here in 
			Annapolis is not to conclude an agreement. Rather, it is to launch 
			negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. For the rest 
			of us, our job is to encourage the parties in this effort -- and to 
			give them the support they need to succeed.In light of recent 
			developments, some have suggested that now is not the right time to 
			pursue peace. I disagree. I believe now is precisely the right time 
			to begin these negotiations -- for a number of reasons:First, the time is 
			right because Palestinians and Israelis have leaders who are 
			determined to achieve peace. President Abbas seeks to fulfill his 
			people's aspirations for statehood, dignity and security. President 
			Abbas understands that a Palestinian state will not be born of 
			terror, and that terrorism is the enemy standing in the way of a 
			state. He and Prime Minister Fayyad have both declared, without 
			hesitation, that they are opposed to terrorism and committed to 
			peace. They're committed to turning these declarations into actions 
			on the ground to combat terror.The emergence of 
			responsible Palestinian leaders has given Israeli leaders the 
			confidence they need to reach out to the Palestinians in true 
			partnership. Prime Minister Olmert has expressed his understanding 
			of the suffering and indignities felt by the Palestinian people. 
			He's made clear that the security of Israel will be enhanced by the 
			establishment of a responsible, democratic Palestinian state. With 
			leaders of courage and conviction on both sides, now is the time to 
			come together and seek the peace that both sides desire.Second, the time is 
			right because a battle is underway for the future of the Middle East 
			-- and we must not cede victory to the extremists. With their 
			violent actions and contempt for human life, the extremists are 
			seeking to impose a dark vision on the Palestinian people -- a 
			vision that feeds on hopelessness and despair to sow chaos in the 
			Holy Land. If this vision prevails, the future of the region will be 
			endless terror, endless war, and endless suffering.Standing against this 
			dark vision are President Abbas and his government. They are 
			offering the Palestinian people an alternative vision for the future 
			-- a vision of peace, a homeland of their own, and a better life. If 
			responsible Palestinian leaders can deliver on this vision, they 
			will deal the forces of extremism a devastating blow. And when 
			liberty takes root in the rocky soil of the West Bank and Gaza, it 
			will inspire millions across the Middle East who want their 
			societies built on freedom and peace and hope.By contrast, if 
			Palestinian reformers cannot deliver on this hopeful vision, then 
			the forces of extremism and terror will be strengthened, a 
			generation of Palestinians could be lost to the extremists, and the 
			Middle East will grow in despair. We cannot allow this to happen. 
			Now is the time to show Palestinians that their dream of a free and 
			independent state can be achieved at the table of peace -- and that 
			the terror and violence preached by Palestinian extremists is the 
			greatest obstacle to a Palestinian state.Third, the time is 
			right because the world understands the urgency of supporting these 
			negotiations. We appreciate that representatives from so many 
			governments and international institutions have come to join us here 
			in Annapolis -- especially the Arab world. We're here because we 
			recognize what is at stake. We are here because we each have a vital 
			role to play in helping Palestinians forge the institutions of a 
			free society. We're here because we understand that the success of 
			these efforts to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians 
			will have an impact far beyond the Holy Land.These are the reasons 
			we've gathered here in Annapolis. And now we begin the difficult 
			work of freedom and peace. The United States is proud to host this 
			meeting -- and we reaffirm the path to peace set out in the road 
			map. Yet in the end, the outcome of the negotiations they launch 
			here depends on the Israelis and Palestinians themselves. America 
			will do everything in our power to support their quest for peace, 
			but we cannot achieve it for them. The success of these efforts will 
			require that all parties show patience and flexibility -- and meet 
			their responsibilities.For these negotiations 
			to succeed, the Palestinians must do their part. They must show the 
			world they understand that while the borders of a Palestinian state 
			are important, the nature of a Palestinian state is just as 
			important. They must demonstrate that a Palestinian state will 
			create opportunity for all its citizens, and govern justly, and 
			dismantle the infrastructure of terror. They must show that a 
			Palestinian state will accept its responsibility, and have the 
			capability to be a source of stability and peace -- for its own 
			citizens, for the people of Israel, and for the whole region.The Israelis must do 
			their part. They must show the world that they are ready to begin -- 
			to bring an end to the occupation that began in 1967 through a 
			negotiated settlement. This settlement will establish Palestine as a 
			Palestinian homeland, just as Israel is a homeland for the Jewish 
			people. Israel must demonstrate its support for the creation of a 
			prosperous and successful Palestinian state by removing unauthorized 
			outposts, ending settlement expansion, and finding other ways for 
			the Palestinian Authority to exercise its responsibilities without 
			compromising Israel's security.Arab states also have 
			a vital role to play. Relaunching the Arab League initiative and the 
			Arab League's support for today's conference are positive steps. All 
			Arab states should show their strong support for the government of 
			President Abbas -- and provide needed assistance to the Palestinian 
			Authority. Arab states should also reach out to Israel, work toward 
			the normalization of relations, and demonstrate in both word and 
			deed that they believe that Israel and its people have a permanent 
			home in the Middle East. These are vital steps toward the 
			comprehensive peace that we all seek.Finally, the 
			international community has important responsibilities. Prime 
			Minister Fayyad is finalizing a plan to increase openness and 
			transparency and accountability throughout Palestinian society -- 
			and he needs the resources and support from the international 
			community. With strong backing from those gathered here, the 
			Palestinian government can build the free institutions that will 
			support a free Palestinian state.The United States will 
			help Palestinian leaders build these free institutions -- and the 
			United States will keep its commitment to the security of Israel as 
			a Jewish state and homeland for the Jewish people.The United States 
			strongly feels that these efforts will yield the peace that we want 
			-- and that is why we will continue to support the Lebanese people. 
			We believe democracy brings peace. And democracy in Lebanon is 
			vital, as well, for the peace in the Middle East. Lebanese people 
			are in the process of electing a president. That decision is for the 
			Lebanese people to make -- and they must be able to do so free from 
			outside interference and intimidation. As they embark on this 
			process, the people of Lebanon can know that the American people 
			stand with them -- and we look forward to the day when the people of 
			Lebanon can enjoy the blessings of liberty without fear of violence 
			or coercion.The task begun here at 
			Annapolis will be difficult. This is the beginning of the process, 
			not the end of it -- and no doubt a lot of work remains to be done. 
			Yet the parties can approach this work with confidence. The time is 
			right. The cause is just. And with hard effort, I know they can 
			succeed.President Abbas and 
			Prime Minister Olmert, I pledge to devote my effort during my time 
			as President to do all I can to help you achieve this ambitious 
			goal. I give you my personal commitment to support your work with 
			the resources and resolve of the American government. I believe a 
			day is coming when freedom will yield the peace we desire. And the 
			land that is holy to so many will see the light of peace.The day is coming when 
			Palestinians will enjoy the blessings that freedom brings -- and all 
			Israelis will enjoy the security they deserve. That day is coming. 
			The day is coming when the terrorists and extremists who threaten 
			the Israeli and Palestinian people will be marginalized and 
			eventually defeated. And when that day comes, future generations 
			will look to the work we began here at Annapolis. They will give 
			thanks to the leaders who gathered on the banks of the Chesapeake 
			for their vision, their wisdom and courage to choose a future of 
			freedom and peace.Thanks for coming. May

		Bush, President of the United States of America, I welcome you in 
		Ramallah, as well as in Bethlehem, on the land of Palestine, that 
		welcomes you today as a great guest, that goes with him, commitment 
		towards the peace process. It's a historic visit that gives our people 
		great hope in the fact that your great nation is standing and supporting 
		their dream and their yearning towards freedom and independence and 
		living in peace in this area, alongside their neighbors.Our people will not forget Your Excellency, your invitation and your 
		commitment towards the establishment of an independent Palestinian 
		state. You are the first American President that confirms and reiterates 
		this right.[Translation earpiece not working.]President Bush:I haven't got it yet. You may have to start over.  
		Not yet. You better stay awake.President Abbas:Our people, Your Excellency --President Bush:I agree completely.President Abbas:Your commitment towards an establishment of an 
		independent Palestinian state -- you are the first American President to 
		reiterate this right. The conferences of Annapolis and Paris were an 
		historic step from you and from the American people and the world as a 
		whole to perfect this commitment and push it forward.Our Palestinian people, who committed to peace as a strategic option, 
		want to see, through your support and your intervention, and end to its 
		suffering and the suffering of its people and their families, and wants 
		to move freely in their homeland, and develop their life and their 
		economy without any obstacles that hinder that progress, and without a 
		separation wall that fragments the land, and without settlements that is 
		governing its land and future. We want to see a different future where 
		prisons are not crowded with thousands of prisoners, and where hospitals 
		are not crowded with tens of innocent victims every day, without 
		checkpoints and queues of ordinary people who suffer from humiliation 
		and siege.I would like to point out here that we instructed our government to 
		continue the work towards enhancing security and imposing public order, 
		and establishing good governance that is based on the rule of law, and 
		to consolidate the role of our democratic institutions and strengthen 
		the work of the civil society, as well as work on consolidating 
		development and administrative and financial reform and transparency, so 
		that we can lay the foundations for a modern and democratic state.And the government is taking intensive steps in that direction, and I 
		would like to express our appreciation for the support of your 
		administration in the economic sphere in order to develop the 
		infrastructure and provide new job opportunities, and improve the level 
		of services and all other projects that contribute in improving the 
		lives and the conditions of living for our people.We and our Israeli neighbors, and under your direct sponsorship -- 
		bilateral negotiations that address all issues of final status are core 
		issues -- that we would like to end these negotiations during your term 
		in office and that we -- it will be ending by the -- ending of the 
		occupation that started in 1967, and that establishment of an 
		independent Palestinian state, and its capital, Jerusalem, based on your 
		vision and the international resolutions, and that we find a fair 
		solution for the tragedy of refugees, according to the Arab initiative 
		for peace and according to the U.N. resolutions.And on this occasion I would like to reiterate before you our commitment 
		to all our obligations that we agreed to. And we call upon Israel, as 
		well, to fulfill its commitments according to the road map plan, because 
		we firmly believe that peace is made by a will and a shared commitment 
		among all parties.Your historic visit today to the Palestinian Territories is highly 
		appreciated by our people, and it's a new expression of your deep 
		commitment towards establishing peace on the land of peace. We 
		appreciate the complete seriousness that characterizes your visit and 
		your efforts today to continue and build and capitalize on this 
		important opportunity that is available to us and to the Israelis.We start with you a new year, hoping that this will be the year for the 
		creation of peace. You will hear today in Bethlehem the call for prayers 
		from the mosques, and the heralding of bells at the Church of Nativity, 
		that confirms our common message, the message of human tolerance and 
		real peace that is deeply rooted in our conscience and in our heritage. 
		Your presence today amongst us, Your Excellency, is a reiteration for 
		the call for comprehensive and just peace that you called for and you 
		committed yourself to. And the echo of this call reaches all the people 
		and the countries in our region, because the voice that is now going out 
		of Palestine is the closest and the deepest in reaching the hearts of 
		all the people in the region.Please, Your Excellency, trust that peace in the world starts from here, 
		from the Holy Land. We welcome you again, our dear guest and our dear 
		friend, here in Palestine.President Bush:Mr. President, thank you for your hospitality. We have 
		met a lot in the past and I'm glad to finally have a chance to sit down 
		in your office to discuss important issues.[Interruption in the translation audio.] Is it working?  
		Listen, they say I have enough problems speaking English as it is.I have had numerous opportunities to visit with the President. And the 
		fundamental question I have is whether or not he is committed to peace. 
		It's the same question I had for the Prime Minister of Israel. And I've 
		come to the conclusion that both men understand the importance to 
		democratic states living side by side in peace.President Abbas was elected on a platform of peace. In other words, he 
		just wasn't somebody who starts talking about it lately, he campaigned 
		on it. He also said that if you give me a chance, I'll work to improve 
		the lives of the average Palestinians, and that's what he has done. It's 
		certainly not easy work. The conditions on the ground are very difficult 
		and, nevertheless, this man and his government not only works for a 
		vision, but also works to improve the lives of the average citizens, 
		which is essential for the emergence of a Palestinian democracy.I talked to him today about how -- what we can do to help and, as he 
		mentioned, the United States has been an active financial giver, we 
		helped at the Paris Conference. I firmly believe that the Palestinians 
		are entrepreneurial people who, if just given a chance, will be able to 
		grow their businesses and provide jobs.We talked about the need to fight off the extremists. The world in which 
		we live is a dangerous world because there are people who murder 
		innocent people to achieve political objectives, not just here in this 
		immediate part of the world, but around the world. That's what we're 
		dealing with in Iraq and Afghanistan and Lebanon. And the fundamental 
		question is, will nations stand up and help those who understand the 
		ideological struggle we're in. And the President understands the 
		ideological struggle. He knows that a handful of people want to dash the 
		aspirations of the Palestinian people by creating chaos and violence.And I appreciate that, Mr. President. And I appreciate your 
		understanding that, ultimately, the way to achieve peace is to offer an 
		alternative vision, and that's a vision based upon liberty.Now, look, there are some in the world who don't believe in the 
		universality of freedom. I understand that. They say, like, freedom is 
		okay for some of us, but maybe not all of us. I understand it, but I 
		reject it. I believe in the universality of freedom. I believe, deep in 
		the soul of every man, woman, and child on the face of this Earth is the 
		desire to live in a free society. And I also believe free societies 
		yield peace. And, therefore, this notion of two states living side by 
		side in peace is based upon the universality of freedom, and if given a 
		chance, the Palestinian people will work for freedom.And that's a challenge ahead of us -- is, is it possible for the 
		Israelis and the Palestinians to work out their differences on core 
		issues so that a vision can emerge? And my answer is, absolutely, it's 
		possible. Not only is it possible, it's necessary. And I'm looking 
		forward to helping.You know, there's a great anticipation that all the American President 
		has got to do is step in, and just say, okay, this is the way it's going 
		to be. That's not how the system works. In order for there to be lasting 
		peace, President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert have to come together 
		and make tough choices. And I'm convinced they will. And I believe it's 
		possible -- not only possible, I believe it's going to happen, that 
		there will be a signed peace treaty by the time I leave office. That's 
		what I believe. And the reason I believe that is because I hear the 
		urgency in the voice of both the Prime Minister of Israel and the 
		President of the Palestinian Authority.Is it going to be hard work? You bet. And we can help support these 
		negotiations, and will. I was asked yesterday at a press conference, you 
		know, what do you intend to do; if you're not going to write the 
		agreement, what do you intend to do? I said, nudge the process forward 
		-- like, pressure; be a pain if I need to be a pain -- which in some 
		people's mind isn't all that hard. And they said, well, like -- 
		yesterday, somebody said, well, are you disappointed? I arrived and it 
		nudged the process forward. In other words, we can help influence the 
		process, and will. But the only lasting peace will be achieved when the 
		duly elected leaders of the respective peoples do the hard work.And so I want to help. And I want to help in the region, as well, Mr. 
		President. The rest of my trip will be talking about, obviously, 
		security threats, but also the opportunity to achieve peace. And the 
		Arab world has got an opportunity and obligation, in my judgment, to 
		help both parties in these negotiations move the process forward.I explained yesterday, and I just want to explain again today, there are 
		three tracks to this process, as far as we're concerned. One is the 
		negotiations to define a vision that will be subject to the road map.Secondly is to resolve -- help resolve road map issues. And today I 
		introduced the President to the General -- three-star Air Force General 
		who will be running this process. We have agreed to a trilateral process 
		and want to help the Israelis and the Palestinians resolve their 
		differences over road map issues.And thirdly is to help the Palestinians develop the infrastructure 
		necessary for a democracy -- an economy -- and security forces that are 
		capable of doing what the President and the Prime Minister want to have 
		done. And we're very much engaged. I'm looking forward to seeing Tony 
		Blair tomorrow, who is the Quartet's representative, and to find out 
		what he has been doing and what progress is being made.I am confident that with proper help, the state of Palestine will 
		emerge. And I'm confident that when it emerges it will be a major step 
		towards peace. I am confident that the status quo is unacceptable, Mr. 
		President, and we want to help you. And I appreciate your vision, and I 
		appreciate your courage, and I appreciate your hospitality. And I 
		appreciate you giving me a chance to talk to the press, of course.A couple of questions, I understand.Question:Mr. President Abu Mazen, what are the results of this visit? Mr. 
		President Bush, you said more than once that the Palestinian side must 
		fulfill its obligations. And Mr. Fayyad has had a security plan to help 
		the peace. And when Mr. Fayyad went to Annapolis he commended that 
		security plan, and then Israel destroyed all those efforts in Annapolis. 
		How can the Palestinian Authority do security efforts that are 
		successful, and while Israel destroys and undermines all their efforts 
		in the occupied territories?The other side of the question: Are you willing to give guarantees for 
		the Palestinian side to declaring a freezing on settlements immediately? 
		Thank you.President Abbas:[As translated.] We are fully satisfied with the 
		outcome that we reached through this visit of Mr. President George Bush. 
		We spoke about all topics that might occur to your mind and that might 
		not occur to your mind, as well. All the issues are in agreement. We are 
		agreed on all topics. All topics are clear.In the near future, in the coming few days, we are going to meet in 
		bilateral negotiations with the Israelis in order to discuss the final 
		status negotiations, final status issues. And as Mr. President said, 
		there are three themes -- the other theme is implementing the road map 
		through the committee, the trilateral committee. And the third point is 
		the economic and security conditions in Palestinian Territories. We have 
		great hopes that during 2008 we will reach the final status and a peace 
		treaty with Israel.President Bush:Each side has got obligations under the road map. 
		Settlements are clearly stated in the road map obligations for Israel. 
		We have made our concerns about expansion of settlements known, and we 
		expect both parties to honor their obligations under the road map.Secondly, we're spending -- General Dayton is spending a lot of time 
		trying to help the President and the Prime Minister develop security 
		forces that are effective. There's no question in my mind the commitment 
		to provide security for the average citizen is strong. The question is 
		the capabilities. And the truth of the matter is there needs to be a 
		fair amount of work done to make sure that the security forces are 
		modernized, well-trained and prepared, with a proper chain of command to 
		respond. And I will tell you I firmly believe the security forces are 
		improving.I remember our visit in New York, and we discussed this during the U.N. 
		General Assembly. And by any objective measurement, the Palestinian 
		security forces in the West Bank are improving.And so my message to the Israelis is that they ought to help, not 
		hinder, the modernization of the Palestinian security force. It's in 
		their interests that a government dedicated to peace and understanding 
		the need for two states to live side by side in peace have a modern 
		force.It's got -- very important for the government to be able to assure 
		people that if there is a need, there will be an effective force to 
		provide security. That's just step one of having credibility with the 
		people. And to the extent that Israeli actions have undermined the 
		effectiveness of the Palestinian force, or the authority of the state 
		relative to the average citizen, is something that we don't agree with 
		and have made our position clear.She just called on you.Question:-- [inaudible] --President Bush:No, that's the road map obligation I was talking about.Question:-- [inaudible] --President Bush:Yes. He's asking me about the checkpoints I drove 
		through and my impression about what it was like to drive through 
		checkpoints. I can understand why the Palestinians are frustrated 
		driving through checkpoints. I can also understand that until confidence 
		is gained on both sides, why the Israelis would want there to be a sense 
		of security. In other words, they don't want a state on their border 
		from which attacks would be launched. I can understand that. Any 
		reasonable person can understand that. Why would you work to have a 
		state on your border if you weren't confident they'd be a partner in 
		peace?And so checkpoints create frustrations for people. They create a sense 
		of security for Israel; they create massive frustrations for the 
		Palestinians. You'll be happy to hear that my motorcade of a mere 45 
		cars was able to make it through without being stopped.  But 
		I'm not so exactly sure that's what happens to the average person. And 
		so the whole object is to create a state that is capable of defending 
		itself internally, and giving confidence to its neighbor that 
		checkpoints won't be needed.Now, the vision of the Palestinian state is one of contiguous territory. 
		In other words, as I said earlier in my administration, I said, Swiss 
		cheese isn't going to work when it comes to the outline of a state. And 
		I mean that. There is no way that this good man can assure the 
		Palestinians of a hopeful future if there's not contiguous territory. 
		And we -- that position is abundantly clear to both sides. Therefore, 
		the ultimate vision, of course, is there be no checkpoints throughout 
		the Palestinian state-to-be.And, you know, this is the issue. We're working through how to gain 
		enough confidence on both sides so that checkpoints won't be necessary, 
		and a state can emerge. My judgment is, I can understand frustrations. I 
		mean, I hear it a lot. I heard it -- you know, the chief negotiator 
		spent two hours at a checkpoint. All he was trying to do was go 
		negotiate. And I can see that -- I can see the frustrations. Look, I 
		also understand that people in Israel -- and the truth of the matter is, 
		in the Palestinian Territories -- the average citizen wants to know 
		whether or not there's going to be protection from the violent few who 
		murder.The security of a state is essential, particularly in a day and age when 
		people simply disregard the value of human life, and kill. And so these 
		checkpoints reflect the reality. And what we're trying to do is alter 
		the reality by laying out a vision that is much more hopeful than the 
		status quo.Question:Mr. President George Bush -- you launched war against Iraq after the 
		Iraqi leadership refused to implement the United Nations resolutions. My 
		question now is, what is the problem to ask Israel just to accept and to 
		respect the United Nations resolutions relating to the Palestinian 
		problem, which -- facilitating the achievement of ending the Israeli 
		occupation to the Arab territories and facilitating also the solution 
		between Palestinians and the Israelis?And for Mahmoud Abbas, did you ask President George Bush to ask Israel 
		to freeze settlements fully in order to enable negotiations from 
		success?President Bush:Yes, but tell me the part about the U.N. thing again? 
		What were you -- I couldn't understand you very well.Question:I just asked why you ask Israel to accept the United Nations 
		resolutions related to the Palestinian problem, just to facilitate the 
		solution, and to end the occupation.President Bush:Actually, I'm asking Israel to negotiate in good faith 
		with an elected leader of the Palestinian Territory to come up with a 
		permanent solution that -- look, the U.N. deal didn't work in the past. 
		And so now we're going to have an opportunity to redefine the future by 
		having a state negotiated between an elected leader of the Palestinian 
		people, as well as the Prime Minister of Israel. This is an opportunity 
		to move forward. And the only way for -- the only way to defeat the 
		terrorists in the long run is to offer an alternative vision that is 
		more hopeful. And that's what we're attempting to do, sir.We can stay stuck in the past, which will yield nothing good for the 
		Palestinians, in my judgment. We can chart a hopeful future, and that's 
		exactly what this process is intending to do; to redefine the future for 
		the Palestinian citizens and the Israelis.I'm confident that two democratic states living side by side in peace is 
		in the interests not only of the Palestinians and the Israelis, but of 
		the world. The question is whether or not the hard issues can be 
		resolved and the vision emerges, so that the choice is clear amongst the 
		Palestinians -- the choice being, do you want this state, or do you want 
		the status quo? Do you want a future based upon a democratic state, or 
		do you want the same old stuff? And that's a choice that I'm confident 
		that if the Palestinian people are given, they will choose peace.And so that's what we're trying to do, sir.President Abbas:[As translated.] The settlement for us is considered an 
		obstacle for negotiations, and we have spoke more than once with Mr. 
		Prime Minister Olmert, very frankly. And we also spoke in this meeting 
		with President George Bush, and consequently, the President understood 
		this issue. And we have heard the statements given by the Secretary of 
		State, Dr. Rice, and she has -- her point of view regarding settlements 
		was very positive.Question:President Bush, Prime Minister Olmert said that peace is not alive 
		here as long as Gaza militants continue their threats on Israel. How do 
		you see, President, about -- [inaudible] -- from Gaza?And for you, President Abbas, how do you intend, actually, to get 
		control of Gaza, and do you think this is possible by the end of the 
		year and by the end of Mr. Bush's presidency?President Bush:First of all, Gaza is a tough situation. I don't know 
		whether you can solve it in a year, or not. But I know this: It can't be 
		solved unless the Prime Minister -- the President has a vision that he 
		can lay out to the people of Gaza that says, here's your choice: Do you 
		want those who have created chaos to run your country, or do you want 
		those of us who negotiated a settlement with the Israelis that will lead 
		to lasting peace?There is a competing vision taking place in Gaza. And in my judgment, 
		Hamas, which I felt ran on a campaign of, we're going to improve your 
		lives through better education and better health, have delivered nothing 
		but misery. And I'm convinced his government will yield a hopeful 
		future. And the best way to make that abundantly clear is for there to 
		be a vision that's understandable.See, the past has just been empty words, you know. We -- actually it 
		hasn't been that much -- I'm the only President that's really 
		articulated a two-state solution so far -- but saying two states really 
		doesn't have much bearing until borders are defined, right of return 
		issues resolved, Jerusalem is understood, security measures -- the 
		common security measures will be in place. That's what I'm talking 
		about. I'm talking about a clear, defined state around which people can 
		rally.And there's going to be -- there will be no better difference, a clear 
		difference, than the vision of Hamas in Gaza and the vision of the 
		President and the Prime Minister and his team based here in Ramallah. 
		And to me, that's how you solve the issue in the long-term. And the 
		definition of long-term, I don't know what it means. I'm not a timetable 
		person -- actually, I am on a timetable -- got 12 months.  
		But I'm impressed by the President's understanding about how a vision 
		and a hopeful future will help clearly define the stakes amongst the 
		Palestinian people.President Abbas:[As translated.] Gaza it is considered a coup by us, we 
		consider it a coup d'etat what happened in Gaza. Now -- we consider it a 
		coup d'etat.  And we deal with Gaza at two levels. The first 
		is that we deal with the people as part of us and we take full 
		responsibility that is necessary towards our people. We spend in Gaza 58 
		percent of our budget. This is not to -- it is our duty towards our 
		people that we provide them with all the need.As for the issue of Hamas, we said that this is a coup and they have to 
		retreat from this coup and they have to recognize international 
		legitimacy, all international legitimacy, and to recognize the Arab 
		Initiative, as well. In this case we will have another talk.President Bush:Thank you, all.

for pdfDoctor Aida, thank you very much for 
the kind introduction. Ministers, members of the diplomatic corps, and 
distinguished guests: I am honored by the opportunity to stand on Arab soil and 
speak to the people of this nation and this region.Throughout the sweep of history, the 
lands that the Arab people call home have played a pivotal role in world 
affairs. These lands sit at the juncture of three great continents -- Europe and 
Asia and Africa. These lands have given birth to three of the world's major 
religions. These lands have seen the rise and fall of great civilizations. And 
in the 21st century, these lands are once again playing a central role in the 
human story.A great new era is unfolding before 
us. This new era is founded on the equality of all people before God. This new 
era is being built with the understanding that power is a trust that must be 
exercised with the consent of the governed -- and deliver equal justice under 
the law. And this new era offers hope for the millions across the Middle East 
who yearn for a future of peace and progress and opportunity.Here in Abu Dhabi, we see clearly 
the outlines of this future. Beginning with the revered father of this country 
-- Sheikh Zayed -- you have succeeded in building a prosperous society out of 
the desert. You have opened your doors to the world economy. You have encouraged 
women to contribute to the development of your nation -- and they have occupied 
some of your highest ministerial posts. You have held historic elections for the 
Federal National Council. You have shown the world a model of a Muslim state 
that is tolerant toward people of other faiths. I'm proud to stand in a nation 
where the people have an opportunity to build a better future for themselves and 
their families. Thank you for your warm hospitality.In my country, we speak of these 
developments as the advance of freedom. Others may call it the advance of 
justice. Yet whatever term we use, the ideal is the same. In a free and just 
society, every person is treated with dignity. In a free and just society, 
leaders are accountable to those they govern. And in a free and just society, 
individuals can rise as far as their talents and hard work will take them.For decades, the people of this 
region saw their desire for liberty and justice denied at home and dismissed 
abroad in the name of stability. Today your aspirations are threatened by 
violent extremists who murder the innocent in pursuit of power. These extremists 
have hijacked the noble religion of Islam, and seek to impose their totalitarian 
ideology on millions. They hate freedom and they hate democracy -- because it 
fosters religious tolerance and allows people to chart their own future. They 
hate your government because it does not share their dark vision. They hate the 
United States because they know we stand with you in opposition to their brutal 
ambitions. And everywhere they go, they use murder and fear to foment 
instability to advance their aims.One cause of instability is the 
extremists supported and embodied by the regime that sits in Tehran. Iran is 
today the world's leading state sponsor of terror. It sends hundreds of millions 
of dollars to extremists around the world -- while its own people face 
repression and economic hardship at home. It undermines Lebanese hopes for peace 
by arming and aiding the terrorist group Hezbollah. It subverts the hopes for 
peace in other parts of the region by funding terrorist groups like Hamas and 
the Palestine Islamic Jihad. It sends arms to the Taliban in Afghanistan and 
Shia militants in Iraq. It seeks to intimidate its neighbors with ballistic 
missiles and bellicose rhetoric. And finally, it defies the United Nations and 
destabilizes the region by refusing to be open and transparent about its nuclear 
programs and ambitions. Iran's actions threaten the security of nations 
everywhere. So the United States is strengthening our longstanding security 
commitments with our friends in the Gulf -- and rallying friends around the 
world to confront this danger before it is too late.The other major cause of instability 
is the extremists embodied by al Qaeda and its affiliates. On September 11, 
2001, al Qaeda murdered nearly 3,000 people on America's home soil. Some of the 
victims that day were innocent Muslims. And since then, al Qaeda and its allies 
have killed many more Muslims here in the Middle East -- including women and 
children. In Afghanistan under the Taliban, on Iraq's Anbar Province, they ruled 
by intimidation and murder. Their goal is to impose that same dark rule across 
the Middle East. So they seek to topple your governments, acquire weapons of 
mass destruction, and drive a wedge between the people of the United States and 
the people of the Middle East. And they will fail. The United States joins you 
in your commitment to the freedom and security of this region -- and we will not 
abandon you to terrorists or extremists.The fight against the forces of 
extremism is the great ideological struggle of our time. And in this fight, our 
nations have a weapon more powerful than bombs or bullets. It is the desire for 
freedom and justice written into our hearts by Almighty God -- and no terrorist 
or tyrant can take that away. We see this desire in the 12 million Iraqis who 
dipped their fingers in purple ink as they voted in defiance of al Qaeda. We see 
the desire in the Palestinians who elected a President committed to peace and 
reconciliation. We see this desire in the thousands of Lebanese whose protests 
helped rid their country of a foreign occupier. And we see this desire in the 
brave dissidents and journalists who speak out against terror and oppression and 
injustice. We see this desire in the ordinary people across the Middle East, who 
are sick of violence, who are sick of corruption, sick of empty promises -- and 
who choose a free future whenever they are given a chance.We also see leaders across this 
region beginning to respond to the desires of their people -- and take the steps 
that will help enhance the stability and prosperity of their nations. The recent 
elections to your Federal National Council represent the first part of a larger 
reform designed to make your government more modern and more representative. 
Algeria held its first competitive presidential elections. Kuwait held elections 
in which women were allowed to vote and hold office for the first time. Citizens 
have voted in municipal elections in Saudi Arabia, in competitive parliamentary 
elections in Jordan and Morocco and Bahrain, and in a multiparty presidential 
election in Yemen. Across the world, the majority of Muslim people live in a 
free and democratic society -- and the people of the Middle East must continue 
to work for the day where that is also true of the lands that Islam first called 
home.As freedom and justice advance in 
this part of the world, elections are important, but they're only a start. Free 
and just societies require strong civic institutions, such as houses of worship, 
universities, professional associations, local governments and community groups. 
Free and just societies require habits of self-government that contribute to the 
rule of law. And free and just societies ultimately depend on the emergence of 
an engaged public whose citizens feel they have a real stake in their nation's 
future. All these developments contribute to the bond between government and the 
governed, between a people and their nation.Free and just societies also create 
opportunities for their citizens. This opportunity begins with economic growth. 
In any society, the greatest resource is not the oil in the ground or the 
minerals beneath the soil. It is the skills and talents of the people. Or as one 
Nobel winning economist calls this human capital. Across this region, you have 
an abundance of human capital -- in the men and women who are your citizens. By 
strengthening your education systems and opening your economies, you will unlock 
their potential, create vibrant and entrepreneurial societies, and usher in a 
new era where people have confidence that tomorrow will bring more opportunities 
than today.In the last few years, the nations 
of this region have made some great progress. The World Bank reports that 
economic growth is strong and it is rising. Saudi Arabia has joined the World 
Trade Organization. Jordan, Oman, Bahrain, and Morocco have signed free trade 
agreements with the United States. Your nations are attracting more foreign 
investment. Oil accounts for much of the economic growth here. But the nations 
of the Middle East are now investing in their people, and building 
infrastructure, and opening the door to foreign trade and investment. America 
supports you in these efforts. We believe that trade and investment is the key 
to the future of hope and opportunity. We also believe that as we demand you 
open your markets we should open ours, as well. We're encouraged by the movement 
toward economic freedom that we're seeing across the Middle East.Unfortunately, amid some steps 
forward in this region we've also seen some setbacks. You cannot build trust 
when you hold an election where opposition candidates find themselves harassed 
or in prison. You cannot expect people to believe in the promise of a better 
future when they are jailed for peacefully petitioning their government. And you 
cannot stand up a modern and confident nation when you do not allow people to 
voice their legitimate criticisms.The United States appreciates that 
democratic progress requires tough choices. Our own history teaches us that the 
road to freedom is not always even, and democracy does not come overnight. Yet 
we also know that for all the difficulties, a society based on liberty is worth 
the sacrifice. We know that democracy is the only form of government that treats 
individuals with the dignity and equality that is their right. We know from 
experience that democracy is the only system of government that yields lasting 
peace and stability. In a democracy, leaders depend on their people -- and most 
people do not want war and bloodshed and violence. Most people want lives of 
peace and opportunity. So it is the declared policy of the United States to 
support these peoples as they claim their freedom -- as a matter of natural 
right and national interest.I recognize that some people -- 
including some in my own country -- believe it is a mistake to support 
democratic freedom in the Middle East. They say that the Arab people are not 
""ready"" for democracy. Of course, that is exactly what people said about the 
Japanese after World War II. Some said that having an Emperor was incompatible 
with democracy. Some said that the Japanese religion was incompatible with 
democracy. Some said that advancing freedom in Japan and the Pacific was unwise, 
because our interests lay in supporting pro-American leaders no matter how they 
ruled their people.Fortunately, America rejected this 
advice, kept our faith in freedom, and stood with the people of Asia. The 
results are now in. Today the people of Japan have both a working democracy and 
a hereditary emperor. They have preserved their traditional religious practices 
while tolerating the faiths of others. They are surrounded by many democracies 
that reflect the full diversity of the region. Some of these democracies have 
constitutional monarchies, some have parliaments, and some have presidents. Some 
of these democracies have Christian majorities, some have Muslim majorities, 
some have Hindu or Buddhist majorities. Yet for all the differences, the free 
nations of Asia all derive their authority from the consent of the governed -- 
and all know the lasting stability that only freedom can bring.This transformation would not have 
been possible without America's presence and perseverance over many decades. And 
just as our commitment to Asia helped people there secure their freedom and 
prosperity, our commitment to the Middle East will help you achieve yours. And 
you can know from our record in Asia that our commitment is real, it is strong, 
and it is lasting.Today America is using its influence 
to foster peace and reconciliation in the Holy Land. The Israelis have raised a 
thriving modern society out of rocky soil, and want to live their lives in 
freedom and security at home and at peace with their neighbors. The Palestinian 
people aspire to build a nation of their own -- where they can live in dignity 
and realize their dreams. Today Israelis and Palestinians each understand that 
the only way to realize their own goals is by helping one another. In other 
words, an independent, viable, democratic, and peaceful Palestinian state is 
more than the dream of the Palestinians. It's also the best guarantee for peace 
for all its neighbors -- and the Israelis understand this. Leaders on both sides 
still have many tough decisions ahead, and they will need to back these 
decisions with real commitments. But the time has come for a Holy Land where 
Palestinian and Israeli live together in peace.America will do our part. In 
Annapolis in November, the United States invited the Israelis and the 
Palestinians, and other members of the international community to come to a 
conference. And I appreciate the fact that your country sent a delegate. It was 
a remarkable thing to see a Palestinian President and an Israeli Prime Minister 
address a roomful of Arab leaders together. And the result was that the 
Palestinians and Israelis launched negotiations for the establishment of a 
Palestinian state and a broader peace.The talks are just beginning, and 
our hopes are high. At the beginning of my trip, I met with both Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders. I was impressed by their commitment to move forward. And by 
supporting the legitimate aspirations of both sides, we will encourage 
reconciliation between the Israeli and Palestinian people, foster reconciliation 
between Israelis and Arabs, and build a foundation for lasting peace that will 
contribute to the security of every state in the Gulf.And as you build a Middle East 
growing in peace and prosperity, the United States will be your partner. As we 
have done in places from Asia to Europe, we have forged new relationships with 
friends and allies designed to help you protect your people and your borders. As 
we have done in places from Asia to Europe, we're helping you bring your 
economies into the global market. And as we have done in places from Asia to 
Europe, we have launched programs designed to help you promote economic reform 
and educational opportunity and political participation.The United States has no desire for 
territory. We seek our shared security in your liberty. We believe that 
stability can only come through a free and just Middle East -- where the 
extremists are marginalized by millions of moms and dads who want the same 
opportunities for their children that we have for ours.So today I would like to speak 
directly to the people of the Middle East.To the Palestinian people: The 
dignity and sovereignty that is your right is within your reach. In President 
Abbas, you have a leader who understands that the path forward is through 
peaceful negotiations. Help him as he makes the tough decisions for peace. 
Oppose the extremists and terrorists who represent the greatest threat to a 
Palestinian state. The United States will help you build the institutions of 
democracy and prosperity -- and make your dreams of a state come true.To the people of Israel: You know 
that peace and reconciliation with your neighbors is the best path to long-term 
security. We believe that peace is possible, though it requires tough decisions. 
The United States will always stand with Israel in the face of terrorism. And we 
will support you as you work to ensure the security of your people -- and bring 
peace and reconciliation to the Holy Land.To the people of Iraq: You have made 
your choice for democracy, and you have stood firm in face of terrible acts of 
murder. The terrorists and extremists cannot prevail. They are tormented by the 
sight of an old man voting, or a young girl going to school -- because they know 
a successful democracy is a mortal threat to their ambitions. The United States 
is fighting side by side with Sunni and Shia and Kurd to root out the terrorists 
and extremists. We have dealt them serious blows. The United States will 
continue to support you as you build the institutions of a free society. And 
together we'll defeat our common enemies.To the people of Iran: You are rich 
in culture and talent. You have a right to live under a government that listens 
to your wishes, respects your talents, and allows you to build better lives for 
your families. Unfortunately, your government denies you these opportunities, 
and threatens the peace and stability of your neighbors. So we call on the 
regime in Tehran to heed your will, and to make itself accountable to you. The 
day will come when the people of Iran have a government that embraces liberty 
and justice, and Iran joins the community of free nations. And when that good 
day comes, you will have no better friend than the United States of America.To the leaders across the Middle 
East who are fighting the extremists: The United States will stand with you as 
you confront the terrorists and radicals. We urge you to join us in committing 
the resources to help the Palestinians build the institutions of a free society. 
Help the citizens of Lebanon preserve their government and their sovereignty in 
the face of outside pressure from their neighbors. Show the Iraqis that you 
support them in their effort to build a more hopeful nation. And as you do these 
things, the best way to defeat the extremists in your midst is by opening your 
societies, and trusting in your people, and giving them a voice in their nation.And finally, to the people of the 
Middle East: We hear your cries for justice. We share your desire for a free and 
prosperous future. And as you struggle to find your voice and make your way in 
this world, the United States will stand with you.For most of the world, there's no 
greater symbol of America than the Statue of Liberty. It was designed by a man 
who traveled widely in this part of the world -- and who had originally 
envisioned his woman bearing a torch as standing over the Suez Canal. 
Ultimately, of course, it was erected in New York Harbor, where it has been an 
inspiration to generations of immigrants. One of these immigrants was a 
poet-writer named Ameen Rihani. Gazing at her lamp held high, he wondered 
whether her sister might be erected in the lands of his Arab forefathers. Here 
is how he put it: ""When will you turn your face toward the East, oh Liberty?""My friends, a future of liberty 
stands before you. It is your right. It is your dream. And it is your destiny.",sh address abu dhabi history freedom middle abu dhabi freedom extremism middle eastdelivered january emirate palace hotel unite arab emiratesaudio require flash audioyour

for pdfOver the past several months I've 
held a series of meetings with my economic team on the outlook for the U.S. 
economy. And before I left for the Middle East, I directed them to conduct a 
thorough assessment of our economic condition, consult with members of Congress, 
and provide me with their recommendations about any actions we might need to 
take.The economic team reports that 
our economy has a solid foundation, but that there are areas of real concern. 
Our economy is still creating jobs, though at a reduced pace. Consumer spending 
is still growing, but the housing market is declining. Business investment and 
exports are still rising, but the cost of imported oil has increased.My administration has been watching 
our economy carefully. My advisors and many outside experts expect that our 
economy will continue to grow over the coming year, but at a slower rate than we 
have enjoyed for the past few years. And there is a risk of a downturn. 
Continued instability in the housing and financial markets could cause 
additional harm to our overall economy, and put our growth and job creation in 
jeopardy.In recent months, we've taken steps 
to shore up the housing market, including measures to help struggling homeowners 
avoid foreclosure and to keep their homes. I've also asked Congress to pass 
legislation to modernize the Federal Housing Administration and enable it to 
provide additional assistance to struggling homeowners. The House passed a bill 
and the Senate passed a bill, and now they need to get together and get a bill 
to my desk as quickly as possible.After careful consideration, and 
after discussions with members of Congress, I have concluded that additional 
action is needed. To keep our economy growing and creating jobs, Congress and 
the administration need to work to enact an economic growth package as soon as 
possible.As Congress considers such a plan, 
there are certain principles that must guide its deliberations: This growth 
package must be big enough to make a difference in an economy as large and 
dynamic as ours -- which means it should be about 1 percent of GDP. This growth 
package must be built on broad-based tax relief that will directly affect 
economic growth -- and not the kind of spending projects that would have little 
immediate impact on our economy. This growth package must be temporary and take 
effect right away -- so we can get help to our economy when it needs it most. 
And this growth package must not include any tax increases.Specifically, this growth package 
should bolster both business investment and consumer spending, which are 
critical to economic growth. And this would require two key provisions: To be 
effective, a growth package must include tax incentives for American businesses, 
including small businesses, to make major investments in their enterprises this 
year. Giving them an incentive to invest now will encourage business owners to 
expand their operations, create new jobs, and inject new energy into our economy 
in the process.To be effective, a growth package 
must also include direct and rapid income tax relief for the American people. 
Americans could use this money as they see fit -- to help meet their monthly 
bills, cover higher costs at the gas pump, or pay for other basic necessities. 
Letting Americans keep more of their own money should increase consumer 
spending, and lift our economy at a time when people otherwise might spend less.Yesterday, I spoke to members of the 
congressional leadership from both political parties. They shared with me their 
thoughts on the best way forward. And I was encouraged by those discussions and 
I believe there is enough broad consensus that we can come up with a package 
that can be approved with bipartisan support. I've asked Treasury Secretary Hank 
Paulson to lead my administration's efforts to forge an agreement with Congress, 
so that we can deliver this needed boost to our economy as quickly as possible.Passing a new growth package is our 
most pressing economic priority. When that is done, Congress must turn to the 
most important economic priority for our country, and that's making sure the tax 
relief that is now in place is not taken away. A source of uncertainty in our 
economy is that this tax relief is set to expire at the end of 2010. Unless 
Congress acts, the American people will face massive tax increases in less than 
three years. The marriage penalty will make a comeback; the child tax credit 
will be cut in half; the death tax will come back to life; and tax rates will go 
up on regular income, capital gains, and dividends. This tax increase would put 
jobs and economic growth at risk, and Congress has a responsibility to keep that 
from happening. So it's critical that Congress make this tax relief permanent.We're in the midst of a challenging 
period, and I know Americans are concerned about our economic future. But our 
economy has seen challenging times before -- and it is resilient.In a vibrant economy, markets rise 
and decline. We cannot change that fundamental dynamic. As a matter of fact, 
eliminating risk altogether would also eliminate the innovation and productivity 
that drives the creation of jobs and wealth in America. Yet there are also times 
when swift and temporary actions can help ensure that inevitable market 
adjustments do not undermine the health of the broader economy. This is such a 
moment.By passing an effective growth 
package quickly, we can provide a shot in the arm to keep a fundamentally strong 
economy healthy. And it will help keep economic sectors that are going through 
adjustments, such as the housing market, from adversely affecting other parts of 
our economy.I'm optimistic about our economic 
future, because Americans have shown time and again that they are the most 
industrious, creative, and enterprising people in the world. That is what has 
made our economy strong. That is what will make it stronger in the challenging 
times ahead.Thank you.",growth plan economic growth packagedelivered january roosevelt room white houseaudio require flash audioyour browser support audio pdfover past several month hold series meet

for pdfMadam Speaker, Vice President 

Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:Seven 

years have passed since I first stood before you at this rostrum. In that time, 

our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined. We faced 

hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in the world economy, and 

the health and welfare of our citizens. These issues call for vigorous debate, 

and I think it's fair to say we've answered the call. Yet history will record 

that amid our differences, we acted with purpose. And together, we showed the 

world the power and resilience of American self-government.All of us were sent to Washington to 

carry out the people's business. That is the purpose of this body. It is the 

meaning of our oath. It remains our charge to keep.The actions of the 110th Congress 

will affect the security and prosperity of our nation long after this session 

has ended. In this election year, let us show our fellow Americans that we 

recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them. Let us show them 

that Republicans and Democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results 

at the same time.From expanding opportunity to 

protecting our country, we've made good progress. Yet we have unfinished 

business before us, and the American people expect us to get it done.In the work ahead, we must be guided 

by the philosophy that made our nation great. As Americans, we believe in the 

power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history. 

We believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom 

of ordinary citizens. And so in all we do, we must trust in the ability of free 

peoples to make wise decisions, and empower them to improve their lives for 

their futures.To build a prosperous future, we 

must trust people with their own money and empower them to grow our economy. As 

we meet tonight, our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty. America has 

added jobs for a record 52 straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower 

pace. Wages are up, but so are prices for food and gas. Exports are rising, but 

the housing market has declined. At kitchen tables across our country, there is 

a concern about our economic future.In the long run, Americans can be 

confident about our economic growth. But in the short run, we can all see that 

that growth is slowing. So last week, my administration reached agreement with 

Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader Boehner on a robust growth package that 

includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business 

investment. The temptation will be to load up the bill. That would delay it or 

derail it, and neither option is acceptable. This is a good agreement that will 

keep our economy growing and our people working. And this Congress must pass it 

as soon as possible.We have other work to do on taxes. 

Unless Congress acts, most of the tax relief we've delivered over the past seven 

years will be taken away. Some in Washington argue that letting tax relief 

expire is not a tax increase. Try explaining that to 116 million American 

taxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800. Others have 

said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes. I welcome their 

enthusiasm. I'm pleased to report that the IRS accepts both checks and money 

orders.Most Americans think their taxes are 

high enough. With all the other pressures on their finances, American families 

should not have to worry about their federal government taking a bigger bite out 

of their paychecks. There's only one way to eliminate this uncertainty: Make the 

tax relief permanent. And members of Congress should know: If any bill raises 

taxes reaches my desk, I will veto it.Just as we trust Americans with 

their own money, we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars 

wisely. Next week, I'll send you a budget that terminates or substantially 

reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs, totaling more than $18 billion. The 

budget that I will submit will keep America on track for a surplus in 2012. 

American families have to balance their budgets; so should their government.The people's trust in their 

government is undermined by congressional earmarks -- special interest projects 

that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate. Last 

year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. I 

also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even 

come to a vote. Unfortunately, neither goal was met. So this time, if you send 

me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in 

half, I'll send it back to you with my veto.And tomorrow, I will issue an 

executive order that directs federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that 

is not voted on by Congress. If these items are truly worth funding, Congress 

should debate them in the open and hold a public vote.Our shared responsibilities extend 

beyond matters of taxes and spending. On housing, we must trust Americans with 

the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times 

in the housing market. My administration brought together the HOPE NOW alliance, 

which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. And Congress can 

help even more. Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to reform Fannie Mae and 

Freddie Mac, modernize the Federal Housing Administration, and allow state 

housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their 

mortgages. These are difficult times for many American families, and by taking 

these steps, we can help more of them keep their homes.To build a future of quality health 

care, we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower 

them with better information and better options. We share a common goal: making 

health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans. The best way to 

achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not government control. So I 

have proposed ending the bias in the tax code against those who do not get their 

health insurance through their employer. This one reform would put private 

coverage within reach for millions, and I call on the Congress to pass it this 

year.The Congress must also expand health 

savings accounts, create Association Health Plans for small businesses, promote 

health information technology, and confront the epidemic of junk medical 

lawsuits. With all these steps, we will help ensure that decisions about your 

medical care are made in the privacy of your doctor's office -- not in the halls 

of Congress.On education, we must trust students 

to learn if given the chance, and empower parents to demand results from our 

schools. In neighborhoods across our country, there are boys and girls with 

dreams -- and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them.Six years ago, we came together to 

pass the No Child Left Behind Act, and today no one can deny its results. Last 

year, fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record. 

Reading scores are on the rise. African American and Hispanic students posted 

all-time highs. Now we must work together to increase accountability, add 

flexibility for states and districts, reduce the number of high school dropouts, 

provide extra help for struggling schools.Members of Congress: The No Child 

Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement. It is succeeding. And we owe it to 

America's children, their parents, and their teachers to strengthen this good 

law.We must also do more to help 

children when their schools do not measure up. Thanks to the D.C. Opportunity 

Scholarships you approved, more than 2,600 of the poorest children in our 

Nation's Capital have found new hope at a faith-based or other non-public 

school. Sadly, these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of 

America's inner cities. So I will convene a White House summit aimed at 

strengthening these lifelines of learning. And to open the doors of these 

schools to more children, I ask you to support a new $300 million program called 

Pell Grants for Kids. We have seen how Pell Grants help low-income college 

students realize their full potential. Together, we've expanded the size and 

reach of these grants. Now let us apply that same spirit to help liberate poor 

children trapped in failing public schools.On trade, we must trust American 

workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new 

markets overseas. Today, our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability 

to sell American goods and crops and services all over the world. So we're 

working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can. We're 

working for a successful Doha Round of trade talks, and we must complete a good 

agreement this year. At the same time, we're pursuing opportunities to open up 

new markets by passing free trade agreements.I thank the Congress for approving a 

good agreement with Peru. And now I ask you to approve agreements with Colombia 

and Panama and South Korea. Many products from these nations now enter America 

duty-free, yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets. These 

agreements will level the playing field. They will give us better access to 

nearly 100 million customers. They will support good jobs for the finest workers 

in the world: those whose products say ""Made in the USA.""These agreements also promote 

America's strategic interests. The first agreement that will come before you is 

with Colombia, a friend of America that is confronting violence and terror, and 

fighting drug traffickers. If we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden 

the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere. So we must come together, 

pass this agreement, and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads 

to a better life.Trade brings better jobs and better 

choices and better prices. Yet for some Americans, trade can mean losing a job, 

and the federal government has a responsibility to help. I ask Congress to 

reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance, so we can help these 

displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs.To build a future of energy 

security, we must trust in the creative genius of American researchers and 

entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy 

technology. Our security, our prosperity, and our environment all require 

reducing our dependence on oil. Last year, I asked you to pass legislation to 

reduce oil consumption over the next decade, and you responded. Together we 

should take the next steps: Let us fund new technologies that can generate coal 

power while capturing carbon emissions. Let us increase the use of renewable 

power and emissions-free nuclear power. Let us continue investing in advanced 

battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the 

future. Let us create a new international clean technology fund, which will help 

developing nations like India and China make greater use of clean energy 

sources. And let us complete an international agreement that has the potential 

to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases.This agreement will be effective 

only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free 

ride. The United States is committed to strengthening our energy security and 

confronting global climate change. And the best way to meet these goals is for 

America to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more 

energy-efficient technology.To keep America competitive into the 

future, we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower 

them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow. Last year, Congress passed 

legislation supporting the American Competitiveness Initiative, but never 

followed through with the funding. This funding is essential to keeping our 

scientific edge. So I ask Congress to double federal support for critical basic 

research in the physical sciences and ensure America remains the most dynamic 

nation on Earth.On matters of life and science, we 

must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to 

discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries. In November, we 

witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram 

adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells. This breakthrough has the 

potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the 

frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human life.So we're expanding funding for this 

type of ethical medical research. And as we explore promising avenues of 

research, we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it 

deserves. And so I call on Congress to pass legislation that bans unethical 

practices such as the buying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life.On matters of justice, we must trust 

in the wisdom of our founders and empower judges who understand that the 

Constitution means what it says. I've submitted judicial nominees who will rule 

by the letter of the law, not the whim of the gavel. Many of these nominees are 

being unfairly delayed. They are worthy of confirmation, and the Senate should 

give each of them a prompt up-or-down vote.In communities across our land, we 

must trust in the good heart of the American people and empower them to serve 

their neighbors in need. Over the past seven years, more of our fellow citizens 

have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service. 

Americans have volunteered in record numbers. Charitable donations are higher 

than ever. Faith-based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair, with 

newfound support from the federal government. And to help guarantee equal 

treatment of faith-based organizations when they compete for federal funds, I 

ask you to permanently extend Charitable Choice.Tonight the armies of compassion 

continue the march to a new day in the Gulf Coast. America honors the strength 

and resilience of the people of this region. We reaffirm our pledge to help them 

build stronger and better than before. And tonight I'm pleased to announce that 

in April we will host this year's North American Summit of Canada, Mexico, and 

the United States in the great city of New Orleans.There are two other pressing 

challenges that I've raised repeatedly before this body, and that this body has 

failed to address: entitlement spending and immigration. Every member in this 

chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like Social Security, 

Medicare, and Medicaid is growing faster than we can afford. We all know the 

painful choices ahead if America stays on this path: massive tax increases, 

sudden and drastic cuts in benefits, or crippling deficits. I've laid out 

proposals to reform these programs. Now I ask members of Congress to offer your 

proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital programs 

for our children and our grandchildren.The other pressing challenge is 

immigration. America needs to secure our borders -- and with your help, my 

administration is taking steps to do so. We're increasing worksite enforcement, 

deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings. We've 

effectively ended the policy of ""catch and release"" at the border, and by the 

end of this year, we will have doubled the number of border patrol agents. Yet 

we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we 

create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy. 

This will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate 

on those who mean us harm. We must also find a sensible and humane way to deal 

with people here illegally. Illegal immigration is complicated, but it can be 

resolved. And it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our 

highest ideals.This is the business of our nation 

here at home. Yet building a prosperous future for our citizens also depends on 

confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the 

world.Our foreign policy is based on a 

clear premise: We trust that people, when given the chance, will choose a future 

of freedom and peace. In the last seven years, we have witnessed stirring 

moments in the history of liberty. We've seen citizens in Georgia and Ukraine 

stand up for their right to free and fair elections. We've seen people in 

Lebanon take to the streets to demand their independence. We've seen Afghans 

emerge from the tyranny of the Taliban and choose a new president and a new 

parliament. We've seen jubilant Iraqis holding up ink-stained fingers and 

celebrating their freedom. These images of liberty have inspired us.In the past seven years, we've also 

seen images that have sobered us. We've watched throngs of mourners in Lebanon 

and Pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassin's 

hand. We've seen wedding guests in blood-soaked finery staggering from a hotel 

in Jordan, Afghans and Iraqis blown up in mosques and markets, and trains in 

London and Madrid ripped apart by bombs. On a clear September day, we saw 

thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant. These horrific 

images serve as a grim reminder: The advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists 

and extremists -- evil men who despise freedom, despise America, and aim to 

subject millions to their violent rule.Since 9/11, we have taken the fight 

to these terrorists and extremists. We will stay on the offense, we will keep up 

the pressure, and we will deliver justice to our enemies.We are engaged in the defining 

ideological struggle of the 21st century. The terrorists oppose every principle 

of humanity and decency that we hold dear. Yet in this war on terror, there is 

one thing we and our enemies agree on: In the long run, men and women who are 

free to determine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in 

tyranny. And that is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to the 

people in Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Territories. 

And that is why, for the security of America and the peace of the world, we are 

spreading the hope of freedom.In Afghanistan, America, our 25 NATO 

allies, and 15 partner nations are helping the Afghan people defend their 

freedom and rebuild their country. Thanks to the courage of these military and 

civilian personnel, a nation that was once a safe haven for al Qaeda is now a 

young democracy where boys and girls are going to school, new roads and 

hospitals are being built, and people are looking to the future with new hope. 

These successes must continue, so we're adding 3,200 Marines to our forces in 

Afghanistan, where they will fight the terrorists and train the Afghan Army and 

police. Defeating the Taliban and al Qaeda is critical to our security, and I 

thank the Congress for supporting America's vital mission in Afghanistan.In Iraq, the terrorists and 

extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty, and fighting to 

establish safe havens for attacks across the world. One year ago, our enemies 

were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos. So we reviewed our 

strategy and changed course. We launched a surge of American forces into Iraq. 

We gave our troops a new mission: Work with the Iraqi forces to protect the 

Iraqi people, pursue the enemy in its strongholds, and deny the terrorists 

sanctuary anywhere in the country.The Iraqi people quickly realized 

that something dramatic had happened. Those who had worried that America was 

preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of American forces 

flowing into their country. They saw our forces moving into neighborhoods, 

clearing out the terrorists, and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not 

return. And they saw our troops, along with Provincial Reconstruction Teams that 

include Foreign Service officers and other skilled public servants, coming in to 

ensure that improved security was followed by improvements in daily life. Our 

military and civilians in Iraq are performing with courage and distinction, and 

they have the gratitude of our whole nation.The Iraqis launched a surge of their 

own. In the fall of 2006, Sunni tribal leaders grew tired of al Qaeda's 

brutality and started a popular uprising called ""The Anbar Awakening."" Over the 

past year, similar movements have spread across the country. And today, the 

grassroots surge includes more than 80,000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the 

terrorists. The government in Baghdad has stepped forward, as well -- adding 

more than 100,000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year.While the enemy is still dangerous 

and more work remains, the American and Iraqi surges have achieved results few 

of us could have imagined just one year ago. When we met last year, many said 

that containing the violence was impossible. A year later, high profile 

terrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are 

down.When we met last year, militia 

extremists -- some armed and trained by Iran -- were wreaking havoc in large 

areas of Iraq. A year later, coalition and Iraqi forces have killed or captured 

hundreds of militia fighters. And Iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize 

that defeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their 

country.When we met last year, al Qaeda had 

sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, and their leaders had just offered American 

forces safe passage out of the country. Today, it is al Qaeda that is searching 

for safe passage. They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once 

held, and over the past year, we've captured or killed thousands of extremists 

in Iraq, including hundreds of key al Qaeda leaders and operatives.Last month, Osama bin Laden released 

a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on al 

Qaeda and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq. Ladies 

and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists 

there is no doubt. Al Qaeda is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be 

defeated.When we met last year, our troop 

levels in Iraq were on the rise. Today, because of the progress just described, 

we are implementing a policy of ""return on success,"" and the surge forces we 

sent to Iraq are beginning to come home.This progress is a credit to the 

valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders. This evening, I want 

to speak directly to our men and women on the front lines. Soldiers and sailors, 

airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen: In the past year, you have done everything 

we've asked of you, and more. Our nation is grateful for your courage. We are 

proud of your accomplishments. And tonight in this hallowed chamber, with the 

American people as our witness, we make you a solemn pledge: In the fight ahead, 

you will have all you need to protect our nation. And I ask Congress to meet its 

responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops.Our enemies in Iraq have been hit 

hard. They are not yet defeated, and we can still expect tough fighting ahead. 

Our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 

2007, while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy. American troops are 

shifting from leading operations, to partnering with Iraqi forces, and, 

eventually, to a protective over watch mission. As part of this transition, one 

Army brigade combat team and one Marine Expeditionary Unit have already come 

home and will not be replaced. In the coming months, four additional brigades 

and two Marine battalions will follow suit. Taken together, this means more than 

20,000 of our troops are coming home.Any further drawdown of U.S. troops 

will be based on conditions in Iraq and the recommendations of our commanders. 

General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in the 

""disintegration of the Iraqi security forces, al Qaeda-Iraq regaining lost 

ground, [and] a marked increase in violence."" Members of Congress: Having come 

so far and achieved so much, we must not allow this to happen.In the coming year, we will work 

with Iraqi leaders as they build on the progress they're making toward political 

reconciliation. At the local level, Sunnis, Shia, and Kurds are beginning to 

come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives. Progress in 

the provinces must be matched by progress in Baghdad. We're seeing some 

encouraging signs. The national government is sharing oil revenues with the 

provinces. The parliament recently passed both a pension law and 

de-Baathification reform. They're now debating a provincial powers law. The 

Iraqis still have a distance to travel. But after decades of dictatorship and 

the pain of sectarian violence, reconciliation is taking place -- and the Iraqi 

people are taking control of their future.The mission in Iraq has been 

difficult and trying for our nation. But it is in the vital interest of the 

United States that we succeed. A free Iraq will deny al Qaeda a safe haven. A 

free Iraq will show millions across the Middle East that a future of liberty is 

possible. A free Iraq will be a friend of America, a partner in fighting terror, 

and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world.By contrast, a failed Iraq would 

embolden the extremists, strengthen Iran, and give terrorists a base from which 

to launch new attacks on our friends, our allies, and our homeland. The enemy 

has made its intentions clear. At a time when the momentum seemed to favor them, 

al Qaida's top commander in Iraq declared that they will not rest until they 

have attacked us here in Washington. My fellow Americans: We will not rest 

either. We will not rest until this enemy has been defeated. We must do the 

difficult work today, so that years from now people will look back and say that 

this generation rose to the moment, prevailed in a tough fight, and left behind 

a more hopeful region and a safer America.We're also standing against the 

forces of extremism in the Holy Land, where we have new cause for hope. 

Palestinians have elected a president who recognizes that confronting terror is 

essential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace 

with Israel. Israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful, democratic 

Palestinian state will be a source of lasting security. This month in Ramallah 

and Jerusalem, I assured leaders from both sides that America will do, and I 

will do, everything we can to help them achieve a peace agreement that defines a 

Palestinian state by the end of this year. The time has come for a Holy Land 

where a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine live side-by-side in peace.We're also standing against the 

forces of extremism embodied by the regime in Tehran. Iran's rulers oppress a 

good and talented people. And wherever freedom advances in the Middle East, it 

seems the Iranian regime is there to oppose it. Iran is funding and training 

militia groups in Iraq, supporting Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon, and backing 

Hamas' efforts to undermine peace in the Holy Land. Tehran is also developing 

ballistic missiles of increasing range, and continues to develop its capability 

to enrich uranium, which could be used to create a nuclear weapon.Our message to the people of Iran is 

clear: We have no quarrel with you. We respect your traditions and your history. 

We look forward to the day when you have your freedom. Our message to the 

leaders of Iran is also clear: Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment, so 

negotiations can begin. And to rejoin the community of nations, come clean about 

your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home, cease 

your support for terror abroad. But above all, know this: America will confront 

those who threaten our troops. We will stand by our allies, and we will defend 

our vital interests in the Persian Gulf.On the home front, we will continue 

to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country. This is our 

most solemn duty. We are grateful that there has not been another attack on our 

soil since 9/11. This is not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the 

enemy. In the past six years, we've stopped numerous attacks, including a plot 

to fly a plane into the tallest building in Los Angeles and another to blow up 

passenger jets bound for America over the Atlantic. Dedicated men and women in 

our government toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their 

plans. These good citizens are saving American lives, and everyone in this 

chamber owes them our thanks.And we owe them something more: We 

owe them the tools they need to keep our people safe. And one of the most 

important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terrorist 

communications. To protect America, we need to know who the terrorists are 

talking to, what they are saying, and what they're planning. Last year, Congress 

passed legislation to help us do that. Unfortunately, Congress set the 

legislation to expire on February the 1st. That means if you don't act by 

Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our 

citizens will be in greater danger. Congress must ensure the flow of vital 

intelligence is not disrupted. Congress must pass liability protection for 

companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend America. We've had 

ample time for debate. The time to act is now.Protecting our nation from the 

dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligence and a strong 

military. It also requires changing the conditions that breed resentment and 

allow extremists to prey on despair. So America is using its influence to build 

a freer, more hopeful, and more compassionate world. This is a reflection of our 

national interest; it is the calling of our conscience.America opposes genocide in Sudan.We 

support freedom in countries from Cuba and Zimbabwe to Belarus and Burma.America is leading the fight against 

global poverty, with strong education initiatives and humanitarian assistance. 

We've also changed the way we deliver aid by launching the Millennium Challenge 

Account. This program strengthens democracy, transparency, and the rule of law 

in developing nations, and I ask you to fully fund this important initiative.America is leading the fight against 

global hunger. Today, more than half the world's food aid comes from the United 

States. And tonight, I ask Congress to support an innovative proposal to provide 

food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing 

world, so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine.America is leading the fight against 

disease. With your help, we're working to cut by half the number of 

malaria-related deaths in 15 African nations. And our Emergency Plan for AIDS 

Relief is treating 1.4 million people. We can bring healing and hope to many 

more. So I ask you to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and 

made this program a success. And I call on you to double our initial commitment 

to fighting HIV/AIDS by approving an additional $30 billion over the next five 

years.America is a force for hope in the 

world because we are a compassionate people, and some of the most compassionate 

Americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us. We must keep faith 

with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and 

peace. Over the past seven years, we've increased funding for veterans by more 

than 95 percent. And as we increase funding -- And as increase funding we must 

also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new 

generation. I call on the Congress to enact the reforms recommended by Senator 

Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala, so we can improve the system of care for 

our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope and promise and dignity.Our military families also sacrifice 

for America. They endure sleepless nights and the daily struggle of providing 

for children while a loved one is serving far from home. We have a 

responsibility to provide for them. So I ask you to join me in expanding their 

access to child care, creating new hiring preferences for military spouses 

across the federal government, and allowing our troops to transfer their unused 

education benefits to their spouses or children. Our military families serve our 

nation, they inspire our nation, and tonight our nation honors them.The strength -- the secret of our 

strength, the miracle of America, is that our greatness lies not in our 

government, but in the spirit and determination of our people. When the Federal 

Convention met in Philadelphia in 1787, our nation was bound by the Articles of 

Confederation, which began with the words, ""We the undersigned delegates."" When 

Governor Morris was asked to draft a preamble to our new Constitution, he 

offered an important revision and opened with words that changed the course of 

our nation and the history of the world: ""We the people.""By trusting the people, our Founders 

wagered that a great and noble nation could be built on the liberty that resides 

in the hearts of all men and women. By trusting the people, succeeding 

generations transformed our fragile young democracy into the most powerful 

nation on Earth and a beacon of hope for millions. And so long as we continue to 

trust the people, our nation will prosper, our liberty will be secure, and the 

state of our Union will remain strong.So tonight, with confidence in 

freedom's power, and trust in the people, let us set forth to do their business. 

God bless America.Also in this database:2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,20072009,20102011201220132014201520162017State of the Union AddressesText and Audio Source:

for pdfThank you all. Deputy Secretary 
England, thanks for the introduction. One boss may not be here, but the other 
one is. I appreciate your kind words. I'm pleased to be back here with the men 
and women of the Defense Department.On this day in 2003, the United 
States beganOperation Iraqi Freedom. As the campaign unfolded, tens and 
thousands of our troops poured across the Iraqi border to liberate the Iraqi 
people and remove a regime that threatened free nations.Five years into this battle, 
there is an understandable debate over whether the war was worth fighting, 
whether the fight is worth winning, and whether we can win it. The answers are 
clear to me: Removing Saddam Hussein from power was the right decision -- and 
this is a fight America can and must win.The men and women who crossed into 
Iraq five years ago removed a tyrant, liberated a country, and rescued millions 
from unspeakable horrors. Some of those troops are with us today, and you need 
to know that the American people are proud of your accomplishment -- and so is 
the Commander in Chief.I appreciate Admiral Mullen, the 
Joint Chiefs who are here. Thanks for coming. Secretary Donald Winter of the 
Navy. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte is with us. Admiral Thad Allen 
of the Coast Guard is with us. Ambassador from Iraq is with us -- Mr. 
Ambassador, we're proud to have you here. Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen and 
Coastmen -- Coast Guardmen [sic], thanks for coming, thanks for wearing the 
uniform. Men and women of the Department of State are here as well.Operation Iraqi Freedom was a 
remarkable display of military effectiveness. Forces from the UK, Australia, 
Poland and other allies joined our troops in the initial operations. As they 
advanced, our troops fought their way through sand storms so intense that they 
blackened the daytime sky. Our troops engaged in pitched battles with the 
Fedayeen Saddam -- death squads acting on the orders of Saddam Hussein that 
obeyed neither the conventions of war nor the dictates of conscience. These 
death squads hid in schools and they hid in hospitals, hoping to draw fire 
against Iraqi civilians. They used women and children as human shields. They 
stopped at nothing in their efforts to prevent us from prevailing -- but they 
couldn't stop the coalition advance.Aided by the most effective and 
precise air campaign in history, coalition forces raced across 350 miles of 
enemy territory -- destroying Republican Guard Divisions, pushing through the 
Karbala Gap, capturing Saddam International Airport, and liberating Baghdad in 
less than one month.Along the way, our troops added new chapters to the story of American military 
heroism. During these first weeks of battle,Army Sergeant First Class Paul Ray 
Smithand his troops came under a surprise attack by about a hundred Republican 
Guard forces. Sergeant Smith rallied his men; he led a counterattack -- killing 
as many as 50 enemy soldiers before being fatally wounded. His actions saved the 
lives of more than a hundred American troops -- andearned him the Medal of 
Honor.Today, in light of the challenges we 
have faced in Iraq, some look back and call this period the easy part of the 
war. Yet there was nothing easy about it. The liberation of Iraq took incredible 
skill and amazing courage. And the speed, precision and brilliant execution of 
the campaign will be studied by military historians for years to come.What our troops found in Iraq 
following Saddam's removal was horrifying. They uncovered children's prisons, 
and torture chambers, and rape rooms where Iraqi women were violated in front of 
their families. They found videos showing regime thugs mutilating Iraqis deemed 
disloyal to Saddam. And across the Iraqi countryside they uncovered mass graves 
of thousands executed by the regime.[Musayib Mass grave site dig and bodies recovered]Because we acted, Saddam Hussein no 
longer fills fields with the remains of innocent men, women and children. 
Because we acted, Saddam's torture chambers and rape rooms and children's 
prisons have been closed for good. Because we acted, Saddam's regime is no 
longer invading its neighbors or attacking them with chemical weapons and 
ballistic missiles. Because we acted, Saddam's regime is no longer paying the 
families of suicide bombers in the Holy Land. Because we acted, Saddam's regime 
is no longer shooting at American and British aircraft patrolling the no-fly 
zones and defying the will of the United Nations. Because we acted, the world is 
better and United States of America is safer.When the Iraqi regime was removed, 
it did not lay down its arms and surrender. Instead, former regime elements took 
off their uniforms and faded into the countryside to fight the emergence of a 
free Iraq. And then they were joined by foreign terrorists who were seeking to 
stop the advance of liberty in the Middle East and seeking to establish safe 
havens from which to plot new attacks across the world.The battle in Iraq has been longer 
and harder and more costly than we anticipated -- but it is a fight we must win. 
So our troops have engaged these enemies with courage and determination. And as 
they've battled the terrorists and extremists in Iraq, they have helped the 
Iraqi people reclaim their nation, and helped a young democracy rise from the 
rubble of Saddam Hussein's tyranny.Over the past five years, we have 
seen moments of triumph and moments of tragedy. We have watched in admiration as 
12 million Iraqis defied the terrorists and went to the polls, and chose their 
leaders in free elections. We have watched in horror as al Qaeda beheaded 
innocent captives, and sent suicide bombers to blow up mosques and markets. 
These actions show the brutal nature of the enemy in Iraq. And they serve as a 
grim reminder: The terrorists who murder the innocent in the streets of Baghdad 
want to murder the innocent in the streets of America. Defeating this enemy in 
Iraq will make it less likely that we'll face the enemy here at home.A little over a year ago, the fight 
in Iraq was faltering. Extremist elements were succeeding in their efforts to 
plunge Iraq into chaos. They had established safe havens in many parts of the 
country. They were creating divisions among the Iraqis along sectarian lines. 
And their strategy of using violence in Iraq to cause divisions in America was 
working -- as pressures built here in Washington for withdrawal before the job 
was done.My Administration understood that 
America could not retreat in the face of terror. And we knew that if we did not 
act, the violence that had been consuming Iraq would worsen, and spread, and 
could eventually reach genocidal levels. Baghdad could have disintegrated into a 
contagion of killing, and Iraq could have descended into full-blown sectarian 
warfare.So we reviewed the strategy -- and 
changed course in Iraq. We sent reinforcements into the country in a dramatic 
policy shift that is now known as ""the surge."" General David Petraeus took 
command with a new mission: Work with Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people, 
pressure [sic] the enemy into strongholds, and deny the terrorists sanctuary 
anywhere in the country. And that is precisely what we have done.In Anbar, Sunni tribal leaders had 
grown tired of al Qaeda's brutality and started a popular uprising, called the 
""Anbar Awakening."" To take advantage of this opportunity, we sent 4,000 
additional Marines to help these brave Iraqis drive al Qaeda from the province. 
As this effort succeeded, it inspired other Iraqis to take up the fight. Soon 
similar uprisings began to spread across the country. Today there are more than 
90,000 concerned local citizens who are protecting their communities from the 
terrorists and insurgents and the extremists. The government in Baghdad has 
stepped forward with a surge of its own -- they've added more than 100,000 new 
Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year. These Iraqi troops have fought 
bravely, and thousands have given their lives in this struggle.Together, these Americans and Iraqi 
forces have driven the terrorists from many of the sanctuaries they once held. 
Now the terrorists have gathered in and around the northern Iraqi city of Mosul 
-- and Iraqi and American forces are relentlessly pursuing them. There will be 
tough fighting in Mosul and areas of northern Iraq in the weeks ahead. But 
there's no doubt in my mind, because of the courage of our troops and the 
bravery of the Iraqis, the al Qaeda terrorists in this region will suffer the 
same fate as al Qaeda suffered elsewhere in Iraq.As we have fought al Qaeda, 
coalition and Iraqi forces have also taken the fight to Shia extremist groups -- 
many of them backed and financed and armed by Iran. A year ago these groups were 
on the rise. Today, they are increasingly isolated, and Iraqis of all faiths are 
putting their lives on the line to stop these extremists from hijacking their 
young democracy.To ensure that military progress in 
Iraq is quickly followed up with real improvements in daily life, we have 
doubled the number of provincial reconstruction teams in Iraq. These teams of 
civilian experts are serving all Iraqi -- 18 Iraqi provinces, and they're 
helping to strengthen responsible leaders, and build up local economies, and 
bring Iraqis together so that reconciliation can happen from the ground up. 
They're very effective. They're helping give ordinary Iraqis confidence that by 
rejecting the extremists and reconciling with one another, they can claim their 
place in a free Iraq -- and build better lives for their families.There's still hard work to be done 
in Iraq. The gains we have made are fragile and reversible. But on this 
anniversary, the American people should know that since the surge began, the 
level of violence is significantly down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian 
killings are down, attacks on American forces are down. We have captured or 
killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key al Qaeda 
leaders and operatives. Our men and women in uniform are performing with 
characteristic honor and valor. The surge is working. And as a return on our 
success in Iraq, we've begun bringing some of our troops home.The surge has done more than turn 
the situation in Iraq around -- it has opened the door to a major strategic 
victory in the broader war on terror. For the terrorists, Iraq was supposed to 
be the place where al Qaeda rallied Arab masses to drive America out. Instead, 
Iraq has become the place where Arabs joined with Americans to drive al Qaeda 
out. In Iraq, we are witnessing the first large-scale Arab uprising against 
Osama bin Laden, his grim ideology, and his murderous network. And the 
significance of this development cannot be overstated.The terrorist movement feeds on a 
sense of inevitability, and claims to rise on the tide of history. The 
accomplishments of the surge in Iraq are exposing this myth and discrediting the 
extremists. When Iraqi and American forces finish the job, the effects will 
reverberate far beyond Iraq's borders. Osama bin Laden once said: ""When people 
see a strong horse and a weak horse, by nature they will like the strong horse."" 
By defeating al Qaeda in Iraq, we will show the world that al Qaeda is the weak 
horse. We will show that men and women who love liberty can defeat the 
terrorists. And we will show that the future of the Middle East does not belong 
to terror -- the future of the Middle East belongs to freedom.The challenge in the period ahead is 
to consolidate the gains we have made and seal the extremists' defeat. We have 
learned through hard experience what happens when we pull our forces back too 
fast -- the terrorists and extremists step in, they fill vacuums, establish safe 
havens, and use them to spread chaos and carnage. General Petraeus has warned 
that too fast a drawdown could result in such an unraveling -- with al Qaeda and 
insurgents and militia extremists regaining lost ground and increasing violence.Men and women of the Armed Forces: 
Having come so far, and achieved so much, we're not going to let this to happen.Next month, General Petraeus and 
Ambassador Crocker will come to Washington totestify before Congress. I will 
await their recommendations before making decisions on our troop levels in Iraq. 
Any further drawdown will be based on conditions on the ground and the 
recommendations of our commanders -- and they must not jeopardize the 
hard-fought gains our troops and civilians have made over the past year.The successes we are seeing in Iraq 
are undeniable -- yet some in Washington still call for retreat. War critics can 
no longer credibly argue that we're losing in Iraq -- so now they argue the war 
costs too much. In recent months we've heard exaggerated estimates of the costs 
of this war. No one would argue that this war has not come at a high cost in 
lives and treasure -- but those costs are necessary when we consider the cost of 
a strategic victory for our enemies in Iraq.If we were to allow our enemies to 
prevail in Iraq, the violence that is now declining would accelerate -- and Iraq 
would descend into chaos. Al Qaeda would regain its lost sanctuaries and 
establish new ones -- fomenting violence and terror that could spread beyond 
Iraq's borders, with serious consequences for the world's economy.Out of such chaos in Iraq, the 
terrorist movement could emerge emboldened -- with new recruits, new resources, 
and an even greater determination to dominate the region and harm America. An 
emboldened al Qaeda with access to Iraq's oil resources could pursue its 
ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction to attack America and other 
free nations. Iran would be emboldened as well -- with a renewed determination 
to develop nuclear weapons and impose its brand of hegemony across the Middle 
East. Our enemies would see an America -- an American failure in Iraq as 
evidence of weakness and a lack of resolve.To allow this to happen would be to 
ignore the lessons of September the 11th and make it more likely that America 
would suffer another attack like the one we experienced that day -- a day in 
which 19 armed men with box cutters killed nearly 3,000 people in our -- on our 
soil; a day after which in the following of that attack more than one million 
Americans lost work, lost their jobs. The terrorists intend even greater harm to 
our country. And we have no greater responsibility than to defeat our enemies 
across the world so that they cannot carry out such an attack.As our coalition fights the enemy in 
Iraq, we've stayed on the offensive on other fronts in the war on terror. Just a 
few weeks before commencing Operation Iraqi Freedom, U.S. forces capturedKhalid 
Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind behind the September the 11th terrorist attacks; 
we got him in Pakistan. About the same time as we launched Operation Iraqi 
Freedom, coalition forces, thousands of -- hundreds of miles away launched an 
assault on the terrorists in the mountains of southern Afghanistan in an 
operation called Operation Valiant Strike.Throughout the war on terror, we 
have brought the enemy -- we have fought the enemy on every single battlefront. 
And so long as the terrorist danger remains, the United States of America will 
continue to fight the enemy wherever it makes its stand. We will stay on the 
offense.But in the long run, defeating the 
terrorists requires an alternative to their murderous ideology. And there we 
have another advantage -- we've got a singular advantage with our military when 
it comes to finding the terrorists and bringing them to justice. And we have 
another advantage in our strong belief in the transformative power of liberty.So we're helping the people of Iraq 
establish a democracy in the heart of the Middle East. A free Iraq will fight 
terrorists instead of harboring them. A free Iraq will be an example for others 
of the power of liberty to change the societies and to displace despair with 
hope. By spreading the hope of liberty in the Middle East, we will help free 
societies take root -- and when they do, freedom will yield the peace that we 
all desire.Our troops on the front lines 
understand what is at stake. They know that the mission in Iraq has been 
difficult and has been trying for our nation -- because they're the ones who've 
carried most of the burdens. They are all volunteers, who have stepped forward 
to defend America in a time of danger -- and some of them have gone out of their 
way to return to the fight.One of these brave Americans is a 
Marine Gunnery Sergeant namedWilliam ""Spanky"" Gibson. In May of 2006 in Ramadi, 
a terrorist sniper's bullet ripped through his left knee -- doctors then 
amputated his leg. After months of difficult rehabilitation, Spanky was not only 
walking -- he was training for triathlons.Last year, at the ""Escape from 
Alcatraz"" swim near San Francisco, he metMarine General James Mattis, who asked 
if there's anything he could do for him. Spanky had just one request: He asked 
to re-deploy to Iraq. Today he's serving in Fallujah -- the first full-leg 
amputee to return to the front lines. Here's what he says about his decision to 
return: The Iraqis are where we were 232 years ago as a nation. Now they're 
starting a new nation, and that's one of my big reasons for coming back here. I 
wanted to tell the people of this country that I'm back to help wherever I can.When Americans like Spanky Gibson 
serve on our side, the enemy in Iraq doesn't got a chance. We're grateful to all 
the brave men and women of our military who have served the cause of freedom. 
You've done the hard work, far from home and from your loved ones. We give 
thanks for all our military families who love you and have supported you in this 
mission.We appreciate the fine civilians 
from many departments who serve alongside you. Many of you served in Iraq and 
Afghanistan -- and some have been on these fronts several times. You will never 
forget the people who fought at your side. You will always remember the comrades 
who served with you in combat [but] did not make the journey home. America 
remembers them as well. More than 4,400 men and women have given their lives in 
the war on terror. We'll pray for their families. We'll always honor their 
memory.The best way we can honor them is by 
making sure that their sacrifice was not in vain.Five years ago tonight, I 
promised the American people that in the struggle ahead ""we will accept no 
outcome but victory."" Today, standing before men and women who helped liberate a 
nation, I reaffirm the commitment. The battle in Iraq is noble, it is necessary, 
and it is just. And with your courage, the battle in Iraq will end in victory.God bless.",sh war iraq five war iraq yearsdelivered march pentagon arlington virginiaaudio require flash audioclick pdfthank deputy

AddressGeorgeW.Bush9/11 Pentagon Memorial Dedication Addressdelivered 11 September 2008, The 
Pentagon, Arlington, VirginiaAudio mp3 of AddressPlug-in required for flash audioYour browser does not support the audio element.Thank you all. Mr. Vice 
		President; Secretary Gates; Madam Speaker; Justices of the Supreme 
		Court; members of my Cabinet and administration; members of Congress; 
		Admiral Mullen and the Joint Chiefs; Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, a first 
		responder on September the 11th, 2001; directors of the Pentagon 
		Memorial Fund -- Mr. Chairman, congratulations; families and friends of 
		the fallen; distinguished guests; fellow citizens: Laura and I are 
		honored to be with you.Seven years ago at this 
		hour, a doomed airliner plunged from the sky, split the rock and steel 
		of this building, and changed our world forever. The years that followed 
		have seen justice delivered to evil men and battles fought in distant 
		lands. But each day on this year -- each year on this day, our thoughts 
		return to this place. Here, we remember those who died. And here, on 
		this solemn anniversary, we dedicate a memorial that will enshrine their 
		memory for all time.Building this memorial took 
		vision and determination -- and Americans from every corner of our 
		country answered the call. Two young architects in New York City came up 
		with the design. A foundry near St. Louis cast the steel. An Iraqi 
		immigrant in Illinois gave the metal its luster. And citizens from 
		across our nation made contributions large and small to build this 
		graceful monument.The Pentagon Memorial will 
		stand as an everlasting tribute to 184 innocent souls who perished on 
		these grounds. The benches here bear each of their names. And beneath 
		each bench is a shimmering pool filled with the water of life -- a 
		testament to those who were taken from us, and to their memories that 
		will live on in our hearts.For the families and friends 
		of the fallen, this memorial will be a place of remembrance. Parents 
		will come here to remember children who boarded Flight 77 for a field 
		trip and never emerged from the wreckage. Husbands and wives will come 
		here to remember spouses who left for work one morning and never 
		returned home. People from across our nation will come here to remember 
		friends and loved ones who never had the chance to say goodbye.A memorial can never replace 
		what those of you mourning a loved one have lost. We pray that you will 
		find some comfort amid the peace of these grounds. We pray that you will 
		find strength in knowing that our nation will always grieve with you.For all our citizens, this 
		memorial will be a reminder of the resilience of the American spirit. As 
		we walk among the benches, we will remember there could have been many 
		more lives lost. On a day when buildings fell, heroes rose: Pentagon 
		employees ran into smoke-filled corridors to guide their friends to 
		safety. Firefighters rushed up the stairs of the World Trade Center as 
		the towers neared collapse. Passengers aboard Flight 93 charged the 
		cockpit and laid down their lives to spare countless others. One of the 
		worst days in America's history saw some of the bravest acts in 
		Americans' history. We'll always honor the heroes of 9/11. And here at 
		this hallowed place, we pledge that we will never forget their 
		sacrifice.We also honor those who 
		raised their hands and made the noble decision to defend our nation in a 
		time of war. When our enemies attacked the Pentagon, they pierced the 
		rings of this building. But they could not break the resolve of the 
		United States Armed Forces. Since 9/11, our troops have taken the fight 
		to the terrorists abroad so we do not have to face them here at home. 
		Thanks to the brave men and women, and all those who work to keep us 
		safe, there has not been another attack on our soil in 2,557 days.For future generations, this 
		memorial will be a place of learning. The day will come when most 
		Americans have no living memory of the events of September the 11th. 
		When they visit this memorial, they will learn that the 21st century 
		began with a great struggle between the forces of freedom and the forces 
		of terror. They will learn that this generation of Americans met its 
		duty -- we did not tire, we did not falter, and we did not fail. They 
		will learn that freedom prevailed because the desire for liberty lives 
		in the heart of every man, woman, and child on Earth.We can be optimistic about 
		the future because we've seen the character and courage of those who 
		defend liberty. We have been privileged to live amongst those who have 
		volunteered to spread the foundation of peace and justice, which is 
		freedom.Seven years ago this 
		morning, police officer Cecil Richardson was on duty here at the 
		Pentagon. He saw the terror that day with his own eyes. He says on some 
		nights he can still smell the burning metal and smoke. Not long ago, he 
		wrote me saying, ""I remember the reasons we fight. I remember the losses 
		we felt. And I remember the peace we will have.""That day of peace will come. 
		And until it does, we ask a loving God to watch over our troops in 
		battle. We ask Him to comfort the families who mourn. And we ask Him to 
		bless our great land.And now it's my honor to 
		dedicate the Pentagon Memorial.",sh pentagon memorial dedication pentagon memorial dedication addressdelivered september pentagon arlington virginiaaudio require flash audioyour browser support audio vice president secretary gate madam speaker justice supreme court member cabinet administration member congress admiral mullen joint chief secretary donald rumsfeld first responder september director pentagon memorial fund chairman congratulation family friend fall distinguish guest fellow citizen laura honor year ago hour doom airliner plunge sky split rock steel build change world forever year follow see justice deliver evil men battle fight distant land day year year day thought return place remember die solemn anniversary dedicate memorial enshrine memory memorial take vision determination american every corner country answer call two young architect new york city come design foundry near louis cast steel iraqi immigrant illinois give metal luster citizen across nation make contribution large small build graceful pentagon memorial stand everlasting tribute innocent soul perish ground bench bear name beneath bench shimmer pool fill water life testament take u memory live family friend fall memorial place remembrance parent come remember child board flight field trip never emerge wreckage husband wive come remember spouse leave work one morning never return home people across nation come remember friend love one never chance say memorial never replace mourn love one lose pray find comfort amid peace ground pray find strength know nation always grieve citizen memorial reminder resilience american spirit walk among bench remember could many live lose day build fell hero rise pentagon employee run corridor guide friend safety firefighter rush stair world trade center tower near collapse passenger aboard flight charge cockpit lay live spare countless others one worst day america history saw bravest act american history always honor hero hallow place pledge never forget also honor raise hand make noble decision defend nation time war enemy attack pentagon pierce ring build could break resolve unite state arm force since troop take fight terrorist abroad face home thank brave men woman work keep u safe another attack soil future generation memorial place learn day come american live memory event september visit memorial learn century begin great struggle force freedom force terror learn generation american meet duty tire falter fail learn freedom prevail desire liberty live heart every man woman child optimistic future see character courage defend liberty privilege live amongst volunteer spread foundation peace justice year ago morning police officer cecil richardson duty pentagon saw terror day eye say night still smell burn metal smoke long ago write say remember reason fight remember loss felt remember peace day peace come ask love god watch troop battle ask comfort family mourn ask bless great honor dedicate pentagon memorial,sh pentagon dedication pentagon dedication arlington virginiaaudio audioyour support vice president secretary gate madam speaker justice court member cabinet administration member chief secretary donald responder september director memorial fund chairman congratulation family fall guest fellow citizen laura year hour doom airliner plunge sky split rock steel change world forever year justice men battle fight land day year year day return place dedicate memory take vision determination corner country call york city design foundry cast steel iraqi illinois metal luster citizen nation contribution build pentagon stand soul ground bench name beneath bench pool fill water life memory family fall place remembrance parent board flight field trip husband remember spouse work morning home people nation chance mourn pray find comfort peace ground pray strength nation reminder resilience spirit walk remember day rise pentagon employee corridor guide friend safety firefighter rush stair world trade center tower collapse passenger flight charge cockpit spare countless others day history history hero place pledge raise hand decision nation time war attack pentagon pierce build state arm force troop terrorist home thank men woman work attack soil future generation place day memory event september visit memorial century struggle force freedom force terror learn generation meet duty tire falter fail learn freedom desire liberty heart man woman future courage privilege amongst volunteer spread foundation peace justice year morning police officer cecil richardson duty pentagon day eye night smoke reason loss peace day peace ask god watch troop battle ask comfort family mourn ask bless dedicate pentagon memorial
83,05 November 2008,>George W. Bush - Rose Garden Speech On Protecting the Nation's Economic Health (transcript-audi,"Good morning. I thank the Treasury Secretary Hank 
Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and SEC Chairman Chris Cox for 
joining me today.This is a pivotal moment for America's economy. Problems that originated in the 
credit markets, and first showed up in the area ofsubprime mortgages, have 
spread throughout our financial system. This has led to an erosion of confidence 
that has frozen many financial transactions, including loans to consumers and to 
businesses seeking to expand and create jobs. As a result, we must act now to 
protect our nation's economic health from -- from serious risk.There will be ample opportunity 
to debate the origins of this problem. Now is the time to solve it. In our 
nation's history, there have been moments that require us to come together 
across party lines to address major challenges. This is such a moment. Last 
night, Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke and Chairman Cox met with 
congressional leaders of both parties -- and they had a very good meeting. I 
appreciate the willingness of congressional leaders to confront this situation 
head on.Our system of free enterprise rests on the conviction that the federal 
government should interfere in the marketplace only when necessary. Given the 
precarious state of today's financial markets, and their vital importance to 
the daily lives of the American people, government intervention is not only 
warranted, it is essential.In recent weeks, the federal government has taken a series of measures to help 
promote stability in the overall economy. To avoid severe disruptions in the 
financial markets and to support home financing, we took action to address the 
situation at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Federal Reserve also acted to 
prevent the disorderly liquidation of the insurance company AIG. And in 
coordination with central banks around the world, the Fed has injected 
much-needed liquidity into our financial system.These were targeted measures designed primarily to stop the problems of 
individual firms from spreading even more broadly. But more action is needed. We 
must address the root cause behind much of the instability in our markets: the 
mortgage assets that have lost value during the housing decline and are now 
restricting the flow of credit. America's economy is facing unprecedented 
challenges, and we are responding with unprecedented action.Secretary Paulson, Chairman Bernanke, and Chairman Cox have briefed leaders on 
Capitol Hill on the urgent need for Congress to pass legislation approving the 
federal government's purchase of illiquid assets, such as troubled mortgages, 
from banks and other financial institutions. This is a decisive step that will 
address underlying problems in our financial system. It will help take pressure 
off the balance sheets of banks and other financial institutions. It will allow 
them to resume lending and get our financial system moving again.Additionally, the federal government is taking several other steps to address 
the trouble of our financial markets.The Department of [the] Treasury is acting to restore confidence in a key element 
of America's financial system:money market mutual funds. In the past, 
government insurance was not available for these funds, and the recent stresses 
on the markets have caused some to question whether these investments are safe 
and accessible. The Treasury Department['s] actions address that concern by 
offering government insurance for money market mutual funds. For every dollar 
invested in an insured fund, you'll be able to take a dollar out.The Federal Reserve is also taking steps to provide additional liquidity to 
money market mutual funds, which will help ease pressure on our financial 
markets. These measures will act as grease for the gears of our financial 
system, which were at risk of grinding to a halt. They will support the flow of 
credit to households and businesses.[The] Securities and Exchange Commission has issued new rulestemporarily 
suspending the practice of short sellingon the stocks of financial 
institutions. This is intended to prevent investors from intentionally driving 
down particular stocks for their own personal gain. The SEC is also requiring 
certain investors to disclose their short selling, and has launched rigorous 
enforcement actions to detect fraud and manipulation in the market. Anyone 
engaging in illegal financial transactions will be caught and persecuted [prosecuted].Finally, when we get past the immediate challenges, my 
Administration looks 
forward to working with Congress on measures to bring greater long-term 
transparency and reliability to the financial system -- including those in theregulatory blueprintsubmitted by Secretary Paulson earlier this year. Many of 
the regulations governing the functioning of America's markets were written in a 
different era. It is vital that we update them to meet the realities of today's 
global financial system.The actions I just outlined reflect the considered judgment of Secretary 
Paulson, Chairman Bernanke, and Chairman Cox. We believe that this decisive 
government action is needed to preserve America's financial system and sustain 
America's overall economy. These measures will require us to put a significant 
amount of taxpayer dollars on the line. This action does entail risk. But we 
expect that this money will eventually be paid back.The vast majority of assets 
the government is planning to purchase have good value over time, because the 
vast majority of homeowners continue to pay their mortgages. And the risk is -- of not 
acting would be far higher. Further stress on our financial markets would cause 
massive job losses, devastate retirement accounts, and further erode housing 
values, as well as dry up loans for new homes and cars and college tuitions. 
These are risks that America cannot afford to take.In this difficult time, I know many Americans are wondering about the security 
of their finances. Every American should know that the federal government 
continues to enforce laws and regulations protecting your money. Through the 
FDIC, every savings account, checking account, and certificate of deposit is 
insured by the federal government for up to 100,000 dollars. The FDIC has been in 
existence for 75 years, and no one has ever lost a penny on an insured deposit 
-- and this will not change.America's financial system is intricate and complex. But behind all the 
technical terminology and statistics is a critical human factor: confidence. 
Confidence in our financial system and in its institutions is essential to the 
smooth operation of our economy, and recently that confidence has been shaken. 
Investors should know that the United States government is taking action to 
restore confidence in America's financial markets so they can thrive again.In the long run, Americans have good reason to be confident in our economic 
strength. America has the most talented, productive, and entrepreneurial workers 
in the world. This country is the best place in the world to invest and do 
business. Consumers around the world continue to seek out American products, as 
evidenced by record-high exports. We have a flexible and resilient system that 
absorbs challenges and makes corrections and bounces back.We've seen that resilience over the past eight years. Since 2001, our economy 
has faced a recession, the bursting of thedot-com bubble, major corporate 
scandals,an unprecedented attack on our homeland, a global war on terror, a 
series of devastating natural disasters. Our economy has weathered every one of 
these challenges, and still managed to grow.We will weather this challenge too, and we must do so together. This is no time 
for partisanship. We must join to move urgently needed legislation as quickly as 
possible, without adding controversial provisions that could delay action. I 
will work with Democrats and Republicans alike to steer our economy through 
these difficult times and get back to the path of long-term growth.Thank you 
very much.",good morning thank treasury secretary hank paulson federal reserve chairman ben bernanke sec chairman chris cox join pivotal moment america economy problem originate credit market first

84,Remarks on the 2008 Presidential Election,">American Rhetoric: George W. Bush -- Welcome Address to 2008 U.S. Olympic 
Teams","Thank you. Welcome. Good 
			morning.This is a special day for the White House. Laura and I are 
			proud to welcome the greatestOlympicandParalympic teamever 
			assembled. And I bring greetings from the honorary captain of the 
			Olympic teams -- President George H. W. Bush. We call him 41.I want to thank the 
			members of the Cabinet who are here, and the administration. I want 
			to thank the coaches and the team leaders, and the U.S. Olympic 
			Committee leadership and staff for being here. We welcome the 
			representatives ofChicago 2016who are here. Members 
			of the U.S. Armed Forces, moms, dads, girlfriends, boyfriends, 
			supporters of the mighty Olympic team, we're glad you're here.I do want to welcome 
			members of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, 
			including John Burke, the Chairman; Dot Richardson, the Vice 
			Chairman -- by the way, member of the 1996 and 2000 U.S. Olympic 
			gold medal softball teams. And the reason I want to mention them is 
			today the Health and Human Services is issuing its Physical Fitness 
			Guidelines, and there's no better time to remind our fellow citizens 
			that physical fitness will lead to a healthy America. Just look 
			what's happened to the people surrounding me. And so we urge our 
			fellow citizens to look at these guidelines and to take time out of 
			your day to exercise. Now, not every one of you has to ride a 
			mountain bike. But if you walk just 20 minutes a day you'll help 
			America and help yourself.Attending the Beijing 
			Olympics was one of the great experiences of our lifetime. Laura and 
			I had a fantastic experience. We will never forget the first night 
			at theBird's Nestfor the spectacularOpening Ceremony. When the 
			Team USA was announced, there was a notable increase in the cheers. 
			And then came the greatest sight of all -- more than 500 America's 
			-- of America's finest athletes marching behind our flag, carried by 
			Bernard Lagat.1It 
			was an incredible sight, and I know it was a moment that all of our 
			athletes looked forward to and it's a moment that we were so honored 
			to share with you.In the weeks that 
			followed, our Olympic team took part in the largest games ever held. 
			Over 100,000 [sic]2athletes competed in more than 300 events. An 
			unprecedented 87 countries brought home medals. Forty-three world 
			records were broken. About 4.7 billion viewers watched the Olympics.And with the eyes of the 
			world turned on Beijing, our teams rose to the occasion. The Olympic 
			team finished with the topmedal countof 110 medals.But more impressive was 
			the decency and character that these Olympics brought on the world 
			stage. I know you worked hard -- the Olympics and Paralympic teams 
			worked hard to get to this moment. Whether you won a medal or not, 
			it really doesn't matter in the long run. What really matters is the 
			honor you brought to your sports and to your families and to your 
			country.And we thank you for the lasting 
			memories that you gave us all. And so here are some of the lasting 
			memories that I will take with me forever. First of all, the Water 
			Cube -- watchingJason Lezak touch outI think it 
			was the French team -- on the 4x100 freestyle relay, and then 
			watching the joy of his teammates, includingMichael Phelps.People say, did you ever 
			get to meet Michael Phelps? I said I did. So that was the highlight? 
			I said, not really; meeting his mother was more of a highlight. She 
			reminded me of my mother -- plainspoken and full of love.So, Michael, we 
			congratulate you. We thank you for joining us today. And we 
			congratulate all the swimmers for the Olympic team.And how about our 
			gymnasts?Nastia LiukinandShawn Johnson. What I found interesting 
			was that these champions were roommates while they were competing 
			for gold. And one wonders whether or not that friendship would be 
			damaged in the heat of the competition. The truth of the matter is, 
			it wasn't. They showed the true Olympic spirit of being competitors 
			in the gym, but being friends in the dorm. And so we welcome these 
			two champions here today, and we thank you for setting such a good 
			example.So, as you know, I'm a 
			baseball guy, and have come to admire women's softball a lot.  
			Yes. So I know with us today are Finch, Duran, Abbot, Galindo, 
			Lappin, Lowe, Berg and Watley -- members of the U.S. Olympic women's 
			softball team.I bring this up because 
			I really think that these women are an inspiration to young girls 
			all across the globe, and the Olympics would be smart to keep 
			women's softball as a part of its program. And I want to thank you 
			for welcoming [me] to your practice.I also want to welcome 
			today a fellow Texan namedLaura Wilkinson. At Sydney she stunned 
			the world by taking gold. This summer, she returned to the Olympic 
			stage for the third and final time, and she was fighting through 
			injuries. But she brought such class to the arena. There was never 
			any of this, ""Woe is me; how pitiful is life."" She said she was 
			honored to compete. She and her husband have returned home to the 
			great state of Texas to raise money for a newdiving center in The 
			Woodlands, Texas. In other words, she had put something back into 
			the community. And I urge all of us -- whether we're Olympic -- 
			Olympians or not to recognize the opportunity to make the 
			communities in which we live a better place. Laura, welcome and 
			thank you for the example you have set.So I spent a little time 
			at the beach volleyball arena. I got to meet Todd Rogers and Phil 
			Dalhausser. These two men are incredible athletes and they -- it was 
			really interesting to be there to watch them warm up. And then they 
			introduced me to the Brazilian team and to the Italian team, and it 
			was really a lot of fun -- but not nearly as much fun as spending 
			time with Misty May-Treaner and Kerri Walsh.These two women are not 
			only great athletes, they're really great people. And I'm just so 
			sorry that Misty May got injured on
			Dancing [with] the Stars. God, if 
			only she had me as a partner, you know? Except I can't dance. But I 
			wish -- you know, it's interesting, I read a comment from Misty May 
			today. She said, yes, I got hurt Dancing on [sic] the Stars, but 
			I'll be back at the 2012 Olympics.I also know that all of 
			us were deeply touched by what happened to Hugh McCutcheon and his 
			family. Nevertheless, we were greatly inspired when the men's 
			volleyball team rallied. They won an incredible gold medal against 
			all odds to really help lift up the coach's family and his spirits, 
			as well as the whole nation's spirits.I congratulate the men 
			and women's basketball teams. You can just imagine what it was like 
			when the men's basketball team asked me to get in one of their 
			huddles right before the game against China. I was like a jockey. 
			But they brought a lot of class to the courts, both teams did. What 
			impressed me and Laura was that the men were there cheering on the 
			women, and the women were there cheering on the men. There was ample 
			opportunity for people to ""big shot"" it at the Olympics. Not our 
			athletes. They were there for the right reason, to support their 
			teams and to support their nations, our nation.Now, one of the things 
			that we really regret missing was the -- being in the Bird's Nest 
			for the 13th Paralympic Games. And we congratulate the athletes who 
			are here, as well. We recognize your hard work, and we're proud to 
			call you Olympians.I'm particularly pleased 
			to be here with those who have worn the uniform of our country. On 
			the America team were 16 men and women who served the nation in 
			uniform -- one of whom wasArmy Lieutenant Melissa Stockwell. 
			She lost her leg while serving our country in Iraq. Four years after 
			hard work, four years after significant rehabilitation, she 
			qualified as a swimmer. And her teammates elected her as the flag 
			bearer for the Closing Ceremonies.We welcome you, Melissa, 
			and we welcome you all.Long after we leave the 
			White House, Laura and I will remember the extraordinary spirit and 
			kindness of the athletes that we have met here at the White House 
			and in Beijing. One unforgettable moment came after swimmerLarsen Jensenwon the bronze medal 
			in the 400 freestyle relay. When he was presented his bouquet of 
			flowers, he looked around the Water Cube and he made a special 
			delivery: He climbed into the stands and he gave the bouquet to 
			Laura. It was an incredibly kind gesture -- and by the way, Larsen, 
			our anniversary is next month if you'd like to go. He also told me 
			something in private, where he said he looks forward to serving our 
			country.Our Olympic athletes 
			have served our country in many ways. But you have a chance to 
			continue to serve. And we honor your service as athletes, and we 
			look forward to honoring your service as worthy citizens of our 
			great country.You amazed the world

for pdf[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly 
from audio]Good morning. Last 
		night, I had a warm conversation with President-elect Barack Obama. I 
		congratulated him and Senator Biden on their impressive victory. I told 
		the President-elect he can count on complete cooperation from my 
		Administration as he makes the transition to the White House.I also spoke to 
		Senator John McCain. I congratulated him on a determined campaign that 
		he and Governor Palin ran. The American people will always be grateful 
		for the lifetime of service John McCain has devoted to this nation. And 
		I know he'll continue to make tremendous contributions to our country.No matter how they 
		cast their ballots, all Americans can be proud of the history that was 
		made yesterday. Across the country, citizens voted in large numbers. 
		They showed a watching world the vitality of America's democracy, and 
		the strides we have made toward a more perfect union. They chose a 
		President whose journey represents a triumph of the American story -- a 
		testament to hard work, optimism, and faith in the enduring promise of 
		our nation.Many of our citizens thought 
		they would never live to see that day. This moment is especially 
		uplifting for a generation of Americans who witnessed the struggle for 
		civil rights with their own eyes -- and four decades later seea dreamfulfilled.A long campaign has now 
		ended, and we move forward as one nation. We're embarking on a period of 
		change in Washington, yet there are some things that will not change. 
		The United States government will stay vigilant in meeting its most 
		important responsibility -- protecting the American people. And the 
		world can be certain this commitment will remain steadfast under our 
		next Commander-in-Chief.There's important work to do 
		in the months ahead, and I will continue to conduct the people's 
		business as long as this Office remains in my trust. During this time of 
		transition, I will keep the President-elect fully informed on important 
		decisions. And when thetime comes on January the 20th, Laura and I will 
		return home to Texas with treasured memories of our time here -- and 
		with profound gratitude for the honor of serving this amazing country.It will be a stirring sight 
		to watch President Obama, his wife, Michelle, and their beautiful girls 
		step through the doors of the White House. I know millions of Americans 
		will be overcome with pride at this inspiring moment that so many have 
		awaited so long. I know Senator Obama's beloved mother and grandparents 
		would have been thrilled to watch the child they raised ascend the steps 
		of the Capitol -- and take his oath to uphold the Constitution of the 
		greatest nation on the face of the earth.Last night I extended an 
		invitation to the President-elect and Mrs. Obama to come to the White 
		House. And Laura and I are looking forward to welcoming them as soon as 
		possible.Thank you very much.",sh barack obama presidential presidential election barack obamadelivered november browser support video require flash audioyour browser support audio pdf authenticity certify text version transcribe directly audio good morning last night warm conversation barack obama congratulate senator biden impressive victory tell count complete cooperation administration make transition white also speak senator john mccain congratulate determine campaign governor palin run american people always grateful lifetime service john mccain devote nation know continue make tremendous contribution matter cast ballot american proud history make yesterday across country citizen vote large number show watch world vitality america democracy stride make toward perfect union choose president whose journey represent triumph american story testament hard work optimism faith endure promise citizen think would never live see day moment especially uplift generation american witness struggle civil right eye four decade later seea long campaign end move forward one nation embark period change washington yet thing change unite state government stay vigilant meet important responsibility protect american people world certain commitment remain steadfast next important work month ahead continue conduct people business long office remain trust time transition keep fully inform important decision thetime come january laura return home texas treasure memory time profound gratitude honor serve amaze stir sight watch president obama wife michelle beautiful girl step door white house know million american overcome pride inspire moment many await long know senator obama beloved mother grandparent would thrill watch child raise ascend step capitol take oath uphold constitution greatest nation face night extend invitation obama come white house laura look forward welcome soon much,barack obama election barack november browser support video audioyour support audio pdf authenticity version transcribe morning night conversation barack obama congratulate senator victory tell count cooperation administration transition senator john mccain determine campaign governor palin people service john nation contribution matter history make yesterday country citizen vote number show world vitality democracy union choose president journey represent story work optimism endure promise citizen think see day moment generation witness right eye decade campaign end move nation embark period change washington thing change state government stay meet responsibility people world commitment work month conduct people business office remain time transition decision thetime laura return home texas treasure memory time gratitude honor sight watch president wife step house pride inspire moment senator obama grandparent child step capitol oath constitution nation face night invitation obama house laura

for pdfThank you all for coming. 
		Mr. Vice President and Lynne, thank you for being here with us. Laura 
		and I welcome you to the South Lawn -- better known as Barney's 
		playground.I want to thank members of 
		my Cabinet who've joined us. We've just finished a Cabinet meeting, and 
		it gave me a chance to tell them how much I appreciate the good work 
		they're doing during this critical time for our nation.I also appreciate the 
		men and women who make up the Executive Office of the President for 
		joining us today. Some of you have been at the White House for just a 
		few months. Others arrived the same day that we did nearly eight years 
		ago. You're the ones who can tell that my hair has gotten a little 
		grayer.  Others are career employees who have been here for 30, or 
		40, sometimes 50 years. I can tell that your hair has gotten grayer.The people on this lawn 
		represent diverse backgrounds, talents, and experiences. Yet we all 
		share a steadfast devotion to the United States. We believe that service 
		to our fellow citizens is a noble calling -- and the privilege of a 
		lifetime.This is an exciting time for 
		our country. Earlier this week, more than 120 million people voted for a 
		new President and Congress -- one of the largest turnouts in the history 
		of the country. No matter how we cast our ballots, this election gives 
		us all reason to be proud of our democracy and our country. And I hope 
		you will join Laura and me in congratulating President-Elect Obama, and 
		wishing him the very best for his family and our country.Just before our inauguration 
		in 2001, Laura and I went back to Midland, Texas -- she was born there 
		and I was raised there. I said that Laura and I would ""never quite 
		settle in Washington."" I told them: ""While the honor is great, the work 
		is temporary."" This is true for many of us here today. This peaceful 
		transfer of power is one of the hallmarks of a true democracy. And 
		ensuring that this transition is as smooth as possible is a priority for 
		the rest of my presidency. We face economic challenges that will not 
		pause to let a new President settle in. This will also be America's 
		first wartime presidential transition in four decades. We're in a 
		struggle against violent extremists determined to attack us -- and they 
		would like nothing more than to exploit this period of change to harm 
		the American people.So over the next 75 days, 
		all of us must ensure that the next President and his team can hit the 
		ground running. For more than a year now, departments and agencies 
		throughout the federal government have been preparing for a smooth 
		transition. We've provided intelligence briefings to the 
		President-Elect, and the Department of Justice has approved security 
		clearances for members of his transition staff. In the coming weeks, we 
		will ask administration officials to brief the Obama team on ongoing 
		policy issues, ranging from the financial markets to the war in Iraq. I 
		look forward to discussing those issues with the President-Elect early 
		next week.Offices within the White 
		House are at work preparing extensive transition materials. We're 
		preparing career employees throughout the administration to take on 
		added responsibilities to help prevent any disruption to the essential 
		functions of the federal government.Taken together, these 
		measures represent an unprecedented effort to ensure that the executive 
		branch is prepared to fulfill its responsibilities at all times. As we 
		carry out this transition I know that you will continue to conduct 
		yourselves with the decency and professionalism you have shown 
		throughout my time in office.A successful transition is 
		just one of many important tasks remaining in our last 75 days. To help 
		address the global financial crisis, the Secretary of Treasury is 
		working endless hours, and I will host an international summit here in 
		Washington on November the 15th. This will be a historic meeting -- and 
		I'm confident that you will work hard to help make it a success.We'll also keep urging 
		Congress to approve America's free trade agreements with Colombia, 
		Panama, and South Korea. And we will continue to protect this homeland 
		by defeating the terrorists and extremists abroad, so we do not have to 
		face them here at home.As January 20th draws near, 
		some of you may be anxious about finding a new job, or a new place to 
		live. I know how you feel. But between now and then, we must keep our 
		attention on the task at hand -- because the American people expect no 
		less. Earlier this year, I promised that I would sprint to the finish. I 
		am keeping that promise, and I know I have given some of you a good 
		workout along the way. As we head into this final stretch, I ask you to 
		remain focused on the goals ahead. I will be honored to stand with you 
		at the finish line.May God bless you.",cutive office employee presidential transition presidential transition executive office employeesdelivered november browser support video addressyour browser support audio pdfthank come vice president lynne thank u laura welcome south lawn better know barney want thank member cabinet join u finish cabinet meet give chance tell much appreciate good work critical time also appreciate men woman make executive office president join u today white house month others arrive day nearly eight year ago one tell hair get little grayer others career employee sometimes year tell hair get people lawn represent diverse background talent experience yet share steadfast devotion unite state believe service fellow citizen noble call privilege excite time country earlier week million people vote new president congress one largest turnout history country matter cast ballot election give u reason proud democracy country hope join laura congratulate obama wish best family inauguration laura go back midland texas bear raise say laura would never quite settle washington tell honor great work temporary true many u today peaceful transfer power one hallmark true democracy ensure transition smooth possible priority rest presidency face economic challenge pause let new president settle also america first wartime presidential transition four decade struggle violent extremist determine attack u would like nothing exploit period change harm american next day u must ensure next president team hit grind run year department agency throughout federal government prepare smooth transition provide intelligence brief department justice approve security clearance member transition staff come week ask administration official brief obama team ongoing policy issue range financial market war iraq look forward discus issue early next within white house work prepare extensive transition material prepare career employee throughout administration take add responsibility help prevent disruption essential function federal together measure represent unprecedented effort ensure executive branch prepare fulfill responsibility time carry transition know continue conduct decency professionalism show throughout time successful transition one many important task remain last day help address global financial crisis secretary treasury work endless hour host international summit washington november historic meet confident work hard help make also keep urge congress approve america free trade agreement colombia panama south korea continue protect homeland defeat terrorist extremist abroad face january draw near may anxious find new job new place live know feel must keep attention task hand american people expect le earlier year promise would sprint finish keep promise know give good workout along way head final stretch ask remain focus goal ahead honor stand finish god bless,office employee transition transition executive office browser support support audio pdfthank vice president laura lawn barney member cabinet join cabinet meet chance tell appreciate work time men woman office president join today house month others day year tell hair grayer others employee year tell hair people diverse background talent experience share devotion state service citizen call privilege time country week people president congress history country matter election reason democracy country join laura congratulate family inauguration laura texas bear raise laura washington tell honor work today transfer power hallmark democracy transition priority rest presidency challenge pause president settle transition decade struggle extremist determine attack u nothing period change day president team grind year department agency government prepare transition intelligence brief department justice security clearance member transition staff week administration official team ongoing policy issue market war look issue house work prepare transition material prepare career employee administration responsibility disruption function measure represent effort branch prepare responsibility time transition conduct decency professionalism show time transition task day address crisis secretary treasury work hour host summit november meet work help urge congress trade agreement colombia panama korea protect homeland defeat extremist draw job place attention task hand people year promise promise workout way stretch ask goal god bless

		Tapper. We have been through a lot together. As I look through the room, 
		I see Jake, Mike, Herman, Ann Compton. Just seemed like yesterday that 
		-- that I was on the campaign trail and you were analyzing my speeches 
		and my policies. And I see a lot of faces that travel with me around the 
		world and -- to places like Afghanistan and Iraq and Africa. I see some 
		new faces, which goes to show there's some turnover in this business.Through it all, it's been -- 
		I have respected you. Sometimes didn't like the stories that you wrote 
		or reported on. Sometimes you ""misunderestimated"" me. But always the 
		relationship I have felt has been professional. And I appreciate it.I appreciate -- I do 
		appreciate working with you. My friends say, what is it like to deal 
		with the press corps? I said, these are just people trying to do the 
		best they possibly can.And so here at the last 
		press conference, I'm interested in answering some of your questions. 
		But mostly I'm interested in saying thank you for the job.Ben.Question:Thank you for those 
		comments, Mr. President. Here's a question. I'm wondering if you plan to 
		ask Congress for the remaining 350 billion dollars in bail money. And in 
		terms of the timing, if you do that before you leave office, sir, are 
		you motivated in part to make life a little easier for President-Elect 
		Obama?President Bush:I have talked 
		to the President-elect about this subject. And I told him that if he 
		felt that he needed the 350 billion dollars, I would be willing to ask 
		for it. In other words, if he felt it needed to happen on my watch.The best course of action, 
		of course, is to convince enough members of the Senate to vote 
		positively for the -- for the request. And, you know, that's all I can 
		share with you, because that's all I know.Question:So you haven't made the 
		request yet?President Bush:Well, he 
		hasn't asked me to make the request yet. And I don't intend to make the 
		request unless he specifically asks me to make it.He's -- you know, I've had 
		my third conversation with him, and I genuinely mean what I say. I wish 
		him all the very best. I've found him to be a very smart and engaging 
		person. And that lunch the other day was interesting, to have two guys 
		who are nearly 85, two 62-year-olders, and a 47-year-old -- kind of the 
		classic generational statement.And one common area, at 
		least the four of us, we all had different circumstances and 
		experiences, but one thing is we've all experienced what it means to 
		assume the responsibility of the presidency. And President-Elect Obama 
		is fixing to do that. And he'll get sworn in, and then they'll have the 
		lunch and all the -- you know, all the deal up there on Capitol Hill. 
		And then he'll come back and go through the inauguration and then he'll 
		walk in the Oval Office, and there will be a moment when the 
		responsibilities of the President land squarely on his shoulders.Toby. Yes, we'll get 
		everybody.Question:Thank you, Mr. President. 
		Do you believe that the Gaza conflict will have ended by the time you 
		leave office? Do you approve of the way that Israel has conducted it? 
		And why were you unable to achieve the peace deal that you had sought?President Bush:Remind me of 
		the three points, will you, because I'm getting --Question:Will it end --President Bush:-- I'm 
		getting a little older.Question:Will it end by the time 
		you leave office? Do you approve of the --President Bush:I hope so. 
		I'm for a sustainable cease-fire. And a definition of a sustainable 
		cease-fire is that Hamas stops firing rockets into Israel. And there 
		will not be a sustainable cease-fire if they continue firing rockets. I 
		happen to believe the choice is Hamas's to make. And we believe that the 
		best way to ensure that there is a sustainable cease-fire is to work 
		with Egypt to stop the smuggling of arms into the Gaza that enables 
		Hamas to continue to fire rockets. And so countries that supply weapons 
		to Hamas have got to stop. And the international community needs to 
		continue to pressure them to stop providing weapons.Hamas, obviously, if they're 
		interested in a sustainable cease-fire, needs to stop arming. And then, 
		of course, countries contingent to the Gaza need to work to stop the 
		smuggling. And it's a difficult -- difficult task. I mean, there's 
		tunnels and, you know, great opportunities for people who want to 
		continue to try to disrupt democracy to provide the weapons to do so.Second part of your 
		question, please, ma'am?Question:Do you approve of the 
		Israeli conduct in this?President Bush:I think 
		Israel has a right to defend herself. Obviously in any of these kinds of 
		situations, I would hope that she would continue to be mindful of 
		innocent folks, and that they help, you know, expedite the delivery of 
		humanitarian aid.And third, why haven't we 
		achieved peace? That's a good question. It's been a long time since 
		they've had peace in the Middle East. Step one is to have a vision for 
		what peace would look like. And in 2002, on the steps of the Rose 
		Garden, I gave aspeech about a two-state solution-- two states, two 
		democracies living side by side in peace. And we have worked hard to 
		advance that idea. First thing is to convince all parties that the two 
		states were necessary for peace.And one thing that's 
		happened is, is that most people in the Middle East now accept the 
		two-state solution as the best way for peace. Most Palestinians want 
		their own state, and most Israelis understand there needs to be a 
		democracy on their border in order for there to be long-lasting peace.The challenge, of course, 
		has been to lay out the conditions so that a peaceful state can emerge 
		-- in other words, helping the Palestinians in the West Bank develop 
		security forces, which we have worked hard to do over the past years. 
		And those security forces are now becoming more efficient, and Prime 
		Minister Fayyad is using them effectively. The challenge is to develop 
		-- help the Palestinians develop a democracy -- I mean, and a vibrant 
		economy in their -- that will help lead to democracy.And the challenge, of 
		course, is always complicated by the fact that people are willing to 
		murder to stop the advance of freedom. And so the -- Hamas, or for that 
		matter al Qaeda, or other extremist groups, are willing to use violence 
		to prevent free states from emerging. And that's the big challenge.And so the answer is -- will 
		this ever happen? I think it will. And I know we have advanced the 
		process.Yes, Suzanne. Finally got 
		your name right, after how many years? Six years?Question:Eight years.President Bush:Eight years. 
		You used to be known as Suzanne. Now you're ""Suz-ahn.""Question:""Suz-ahn."" Thank you.President Bush:I'm ""Gahge.""Question:In your 2002 State of the 
		Union address, you identified U.S. threats as an axis of evil -- Iran, 
		Iraq and North Korea. Iraq is relatively calm; North Korea is no longer 
		on the terrorist threat list. How would you define, if, in fact, there 
		is an axis of evil? And what is the greatest and most urgent threat when 
		it comes to security that Barack Obama has to deal with?President Bush:The most 
		urgent threat that he'll have to deal with, and other Presidents after 
		him will have to deal with, is an attack on our homeland. You know, I 
		wish I could report that's not the case, but there's still an enemy out 
		there that would like to inflict damage on America -- Americans. And 
		that will be the major threat.North Korea is still a 
		problem. There is a debate in the intel community about how big a 
		problem they are. But one of my concerns is that there might be a highly 
		enriched uranium program. And therefore it is really important that out 
		of the six-party talks comes a strong verification regime. In other 
		words, in order to advance our relations with North Korea, the North 
		Korean government must honor the commitments it made to allow for strong 
		verification measures to be in place, to ensure that they don't develop 
		a highly enriched uranium program, for example.So they're still dangerous, 
		and Iran is still dangerous.Yes.Question:You said in an interview 
		earlier this weekend, one of these, I guess, exit interviews, that --President Bush:This is the 
		ultimate exit interview.Question:-- that you think the 
		Republican Party needs to be more inclusive. Who needs to hear that 
		message inside the Republican Party?President Bush:You see, I am 
		concerned that, in the wake of the defeat, that the temptation will be 
		to look inward and to say, well, here's a litmus test you must adhere 
		to.This party will come back. 
		But the party's message has got to be that different points of view are 
		included in the party. And -- take, for example, the immigration debate. 
		That's obviously a highly contentious issue. And the problem with the 
		outcome of the initial round of the debate was that some people said, 
		well, Republicans don't like immigrants. Now, that may be fair or 
		unfair, but that's what -- that's the image that came out.And, you know, if the image 
		is we don't like immigrants, then there's probably somebody else out 
		there saying, well, if they don't like the immigrants, they probably 
		don't like me, as well. And so my point was, is that our party has got 
		to be compassionate and broad-minded.I remember the 1964 
		elections. My dad happened to be running for the United State Senate 
		then and, you know, got landslided with the Johnson landslide in the 
		state of Texas. But it wasn't just George Bush who got defeated; the 
		Republican Party was pretty well decimated at the time. At least that's 
		what they -- I think that's how the pundits viewed it. And then '66 
		there was a resurgence. And the same thing can happen this time, but we 
		just got to make sure our message is broad-gauged and compassionate; 
		that we care about people's lives, and we've got a plan to help them 
		improve their lives.Jake, yes. How you doing?Question:I'm good. How you doing, 
		sir?President Bush:So what have 
		you been doing since 2000 -- never mind.Question:Working my way to this 
		chair.President Bush:So are you 
		going to be here for President Obama?Question:I will. I will.President Bush:That's a 
		pretty cool job.Question:It's not bad.President Bush:Yes.Question:Yours might be better.President Bush:Yes -- what, 
		retirement?Question:In the past, when you've 
		been asked to address bad poll numbers or your own popularity, you've 
		said that history will judge that you did the right thing, that you 
		thought you did the right thing. But without getting into your motives 
		or your goals, I think a lot of people, including Republicans, including 
		some members of your own administration, have been disappointed at the 
		execution of some of your ideals, whether Iraq or Katrina or the 
		economy. What would your closing message be to the American people about 
		the execution of these goals?President Bush:Well, first 
		of all, hard things don't happen overnight, Jake. And when the history 
		of Iraq is written, historians will analyze, for example, the decision 
		on the surge. The situation was -- looked like it was going fine and 
		then violence for a period of time began to throw -- throw the progress 
		of Iraq into doubt. And rather than accepting the status quo and saying, 
		oh, it's not worth it or the politics makes it difficult or, you know, 
		the party may end up being -- you know, not doing well in the elections 
		because of the violence in Iraq, I decided to do something about it -- 
		and sent 30,000 troops in as opposed to withdrawing.And so that part of history 
		is certain, and the situation did change. Now the question is, in the 
		long run, will this democracy survive? And that's going to be the 
		challenge for future Presidents.In terms of the economy, 
		look, I inherited a recession, I am ending on a recession. In the 
		meantime there were 52 months of uninterrupted job growth. And I 
		defended tax cuts when I campaigned, I helped implement tax cuts when I 
		was President, and I will defend them after my presidency as the right 
		course of action. And there's a fundamental philosophical debate about 
		tax cuts. Who best can spend your money, the government or you? And I 
		have always sided with the people on that issue.Now, obviously these are 
		very difficult economic times. When people analyze the situation, there 
		will be -- this problem started before my presidency, it obviously took 
		place during my presidency. The question facing a President is not when 
		the problem started, but what did you do about it when you recognized 
		the problem. And I readily concede I chunked aside some of my free 
		market principles when I was told by chief economic advisors that the 
		situation we were facing could be worse than the Great Depression.So I've told some of my 
		friends who said -- you know, who have taken an ideological position on 
		this issue -- why did you do what you did? I said, well, if you were 
		sitting there and heard that the depression could be greater than the 
		Great Depression, I hope you would act too, which I did. And we've taken 
		extraordinary measures to deal with the frozen credit markets, which 
		have affected the economy. Credit spreads are beginning to shrink; 
		lending is just beginning to pick up. The actions we have taken, I 
		believe, have helped thaw the credit markets, which is the first step 
		toward recovery.And so, yes, look, there's 
		plenty of critics in this business; I understand that. And I thank you 
		for giving me a chance to defend a record that I am going to continue to 
		defend, because I think it's a good, strong record.Jim.Question:Thank you, Mr. President. 
		I'd also like to ask you about your critics.President Bush:Sure. You 
		know any?Question:Well, a couple years ago, 
		Charles Krauthammer, columnist and Harvard-trained psychiatrist, coined 
		a term, ""Bush derangement syndrome,"" to talk about your critics who 
		disagreed with you most passionately -- not just your policies, but 
		seemed to take an animosity towards you. I'm just wondering, as you look 
		back, why you think you engendered such passionate criticism, animosity, 
		and do you have any message specifically to those -- to that particular 
		part of the spectrum of your critics?President Bush:You know, 
		most people I see, you know, when I'm moving around the country, for 
		example, they're not angry. And they're not hostile people. And they -- 
		we never meet people who disagree, that's just not true. I've met a lot 
		of people who don't agree with the decisions I make. But they have been 
		civil in their discourse.And so, I view those who get 
		angry and yell and say bad things and, you know, all that kind of stuff, 
		it's just a very few people in the country. I don't know why they get 
		angry. I don't know why they get hostile. It's not the first time, 
		however, in history that people have expressed themselves in sometimes 
		undignified ways. I've been reading, you know, a lot about Abraham 
		Lincoln during my presidency, and there was some pretty harsh discord 
		when it came to the 16th President, just like there's been harsh discord 
		for the 43rd President.You know, Presidents can try 
		to avoid hard decisions and therefore avoid controversy. That's just not 
		my nature. I'm the kind of person that, you know, is willing to take on 
		hard tasks, and in times of war people get emotional; I understand that. 
		Never really, you know, spent that much time, frankly, worrying about 
		the loud voices. I of course hear them, but they didn't affect my 
		policy, nor did they affect -- affect how I made decisions.You know, the -- 
		President-Elect Obama will find this, too. He'll get in the Oval Office 
		and there will be a lot of people that are real critical and harsh, and 
		he'll be disappointed at times by the tone of the rhetoric. And he's 
		going to have to do what he thinks is right, Jim. And if you don't, then 
		I don't see how you can live with yourself. I don't see how I can get 
		back home in Texas and look in the mirror and be proud of what I see if 
		I allowed the loud voices, the loud critics, to prevent me from doing 
		what I thought was necessary to protect this country.Mike.Question:Mr. President, thank you 
		very much. Since your philosophy is so different from President-Elect 
		Obama's, what concerns you the most about what he may attempt to do?President Bush:You know, 
		Michael, I'm not going to speculate about what he's going to do. It's 
		going to be -- you know, he's going to get in the Oval Office, he's 
		going to analyze each situation, and he's going to make the decisions 
		that he think is necessary.And the other thing is, when 
		I get out of here, I'm getting off the stage. I believe there ought to 
		be, you know, one person in the klieg lights at a time, and I've had my 
		time in the klieg lights. You know, I'm confident, you know, you'll 
		catch me opining on occasion, but I wish him all the best.And people say, oh, you just 
		-- that's just a throwaway line. No, it's not a throwaway line. The 
		stakes are high. There is an enemy that still is out there. You know, 
		people can maybe try to write that off as, you know, he's trying to set 
		something up. I'm telling you there's an enemy that would like to attack 
		America, Americans, again. There just is. That's the reality of the 
		world. And I wish him all the very best.And of course, he's going to 
		have his hands full with the economy. I understand. It's tough for a lot 
		of working people out there. The people are concerned about their 
		economic future. You know, one of the very difficult parts of the 
		decision I made on the financial crisis was to use hardworking people's 
		money to help prevent there to be a crisis, and in so doing, some of 
		that money went into Wall Street firms that caused the crisis in the 
		first place. I wasn't kidding when I said Wall Street got drunk and we 
		got the hangover. And -- but nevertheless, President-Elect Obama will 
		find the problems and the situations surrounding problems sometimes 
		cause people to have to make decisions that they, you know, weren't 
		initially comfortable with. And there was such a decision when it came 
		to Wall Street.I mean, I had a lot of 
		people -- when I went out to Midland that time -- say, what the heck are 
		you doing? Those people up East caused the problem. I said, I know, but 
		if we hadn't worked to fix the problem, your situation would be worse. 
		And -- anyway, I really do wish him all the best.Sheryl.Question:Thank you, Mr. President. 
		Mr. President, in recent days, there's been a fair amount of discussion 
		in legal circles about whether or not you might give preemptive pardons, 
		pardons in advance, to officials of your administration who engaged in 
		anything from harsh interrogation tactics to perhaps dismissing U.S. 
		attorneys. I'd like to know, have you given any consideration to this? 
		And are you planning on it?President Bush:I won't be 
		discussing pardons here at this press conference.Question:Can I have a follow-up?President Bush:Would you 
		like to ask another question?Question:Yes, I would, sir. Thank 
		you. Four years ago --President Bush:That's the 
		spirit, isn't it?Question:I appreciate that.President Bush:Thank you.Question:Four years ago, you were 
		asked if you had made any mistakes.President Bush:Yes.Question:And I'm not trying to play 
		""gotcha,"" but I wonder, when you look back over the long arc of your 
		presidency, do you think, in retrospect, that you have made any 
		mistakes? And if so, what is the single biggest mistake that you may 
		have made?President Bush:Gotcha. I 
		have often said that history will look back and determine that which 
		could have been done better, or, you know, mistakes I made. Clearly 
		putting a ""Mission Accomplished"" on a aircraft carrier was a mistake. It 
		sent the wrong message. We were trying to say something differently, but 
		nevertheless, it conveyed a different message. Obviously, some of my 
		rhetoric has been a mistake.I've thought long and hard 
		about Katrina -- you know, could I have done something differently, like 
		land Air Force One either in New Orleans or Baton Rouge. The problem 
		with that and -- is that law enforcement would have been pulled away 
		from the mission. And then your questions, I suspect, would have been, 
		how could you possibly have flown Air Force One into Baton Rouge, and 
		police officers that were needed to expedite traffic out of New Orleans 
		were taken off the task to look after you?I believe that running the 
		Social Security idea right after the '04 elections was a mistake. I 
		should have argued for immigration reform. And the reason why is, is 
		that -- you know, one of the lessons I learned as governor of Texas, by 
		the way, is legislative branches tend to be risk-adverse. In other 
		words, sometimes legislatures have the tendency to ask, why should I 
		take on a hard task when a crisis is not imminent? And the crisis was 
		not imminent for Social Security as far as many members of Congress was 
		concerned.As an aside, one thing I 
		proved is that you can actually campaign on the issue and get elected. 
		In other words, I don't believe talking about Social Security is the 
		third rail of American politics. I, matter of fact, think that in the 
		future, not talking about how you intend to fix Social Security is going 
		to be the third rail of American politics.One thing about the 
		presidency is that you can make -- only make decisions, you know, on the 
		information at hand. You don't get to have information after you've made 
		the decision. That's not the way it works. And you stand by your 
		decisions, and you do your best to explain why you made the decisions 
		you made.There have been 
		disappointments. Abu Ghraib obviously was a huge disappointment during 
		the presidency. Not having weapons of mass destruction was a significant 
		disappointment. I don't know if you want to call those mistakes or not, 
		but they were -- things didn't go according to plan, let's put it that 
		way.Anyway, I think historians 
		will look back and they'll be able to have a better look at mistakes 
		after some time has passed. Along Jake's question, there is no such 
		thing as short-term history. I don't think you can possibly get the full 
		breadth of an administration until time has passed: Where does a 
		President's -- did a President's decisions have the impact that he 
		thought they would, or he thought they would, over time? Or how did this 
		President compare to future Presidents, given a set of circumstances 
		that may be similar or not similar? I mean, there's -- it's just 
		impossible to do. And I'm comfortable with that.Yes, Mike.Question:One of the major 
		objectives that the incoming administration has talked frequently about 
		is restoring America's moral standing in the world. And many of the 
		allies of the new President -- I believe that the President-elect 
		himself has talked about the damage that Gitmo, that harsh interrogation 
		tactics that they consider torture, how going to war in Iraq without a 
		U.N. mandate have damaged America's moral standing in the world. I'm 
		wondering basically what is your reaction to that? Do you think that is 
		that something that the next President needs to worry about?President Bush:I strongly 
		disagree with the assessment that our moral standing has been damaged. 
		It may be damaged amongst some of the elite, but people still understand 
		America stands for freedom, that America is a country that provides such 
		great hope.You go to Africa, you ask 
		Africans about America's generosity and compassion; go to India, and ask 
		about, you know, America's -- their view of America. Go to China and 
		ask. Now, no question parts of Europe have said that we shouldn't have 
		gone to war in Iraq without a mandate, but those are a few countries. 
		Most countries in Europe listened to what 1441 said, which is disclose, 
		disarm or face serious consequences.Most people take those words 
		seriously. Now, some countries didn't -- even though they might have 
		voted for the resolution. I disagree with this assessment that, you 
		know, people view America in a dim light. I just don't agree with that. 
		And I understand that Gitmo has created controversies. But when it came 
		time for those countries that were criticizing America to take some of 
		those -- some of those detainees, they weren't willing to help out. And 
		so, you know, I just disagree with the assessment, Mike.I'll remind -- listen, I 
		tell people, yes, you can try to be popular. In certain quarters in 
		Europe, you can be popular by blaming every Middle Eastern problem on 
		Israel. Or you can be popular by joining the International Criminal 
		Court. I guess I could have been popular by accepting Kyoto, which I 
		felt was a flawed treaty, and proposed something different and more 
		constructive.And in terms of the 
		decisions that I had made to protect the homeland, I wouldn't worry 
		about popularity. What I would worry about is the Constitution of the 
		United States, and putting plans in place that makes it easier to find 
		out what the enemy is thinking, because all these debates will matter 
		not if there's another attack on the homeland. The question won't be, 
		you know, were you critical of this plan or not; the question is going 
		to be, why didn't you do something?Do you remember what it was 
		like right after September the 11th around here? In press conferences 
		and opinion pieces and in stories -- that sometimes were news stories 
		and sometimes opinion pieces -- people were saying, how come they didn't 
		see it, how come they didn't connect the dots? Do you remember what the 
		environment was like in Washington? I do. When people were hauled up in 
		front of Congress and members of Congress were asking questions about, 
		how come you didn't know this, that, or the other? And then we start 
		putting policy in place -- legal policy in place to connect the dots, 
		and all of a sudden people were saying, how come you're connecting the 
		dots?And so, Mike, I've heard all 
		that. I've heard all that. My view is, is that most people around the 
		world, they respect America. And some of them doesn't like me, I 
		understand that -- some of the writers and the, you know, opiners and 
		all that. That's fine, that's part of the deal. But I'm more concerned 
		about the country and our -- how people view the United States. They 
		view us as strong, compassionate people who care deeply about the 
		universality of freedom.Roger.Question:Thank you. Mr. President, 
		you spoke a moment ago about using taxpayers' money for the TARP 
		program.President Bush:Yes, I did.Question:The first $350 billion is 
		out the door, it's been spent. Are you satisfied that it's been spent 
		wisely? And for the second $350 billion that's under consideration, do 
		you think -- are you supportive of Congress putting some restrictions on 
		it?President Bush:I'm 
		supportive of the President-elect working out a plan with Congress that 
		best suits him -- and Congress. That's what he's going to have to do. 
		He's going to have to go up there and he's going to have to make his 
		case as to why the 350 [billion dollars] is necessary. And he knows 
		that. This is nothing new.And in terms of the first 
		350 [billion dollars,] I am pleased with this aspect of the expenditure, 
		and that is that the financial markets are beginning to thaw. In the 
		fall, I was concerned that the credit freeze would cause us to be headed 
		toward a depression greater than the Great Depression. That's what I was 
		told, if we didn't move. And so, therefore, we have moved aggressively.And by the way, it just 
		wasn't with the TARP. If you think about AIG, Fannie and Freddie -- a 
		lot of the decisions that were made in this administration are very 
		aggressive decisions, all aiming at preventing the financial system from 
		cratering.Question:Mr. President, you spoke 
		of the moment that the responsibility of the office would hit Barack 
		Obama. The world is a far different place than it was when it hit you. 
		When do you think he's going to feel the full impact? And what, if 
		anything, have you and the other Presidents shared with him about the 
		effects of the sometimes isolation, the so-called bubble of the office?President Bush:Yes, that's a 
		great question. He'll -- he will feel the effects the minute he walks in 
		the Oval Office. At least, that's when I felt. I don't know when he's 
		going -- he may feel it the minute he's -- gets sworn in. And the minute 
		I got sworn in, I started thinking about the speech. And so -- but he's 
		a better speech-maker than me, so he'll be able to -- he'll be able to 
		-- I don't know how he's going to feel. All I know is he's going to feel 
		it. There will be a moment when he feels it.I have never felt isolated 
		and I don't think he will. One reason he won't feel isolated is because 
		he's got a fabulous family and he cares a lot about his family. That's 
		evident from my discussions with him. He'll be -- he's a 45-second 
		commute away from a great wife and two little girls that love him 
		dearly.I believe this -- the phrase 
		""burdens of the office"" is overstated. You know, it's kind of like, why 
		me? Oh, the burdens, you know. Why did the financial collapse have to 
		happen on my watch? It's just -- it's pathetic, isn't it, self-pity. And 
		I don't believe that President-Elect Obama will be full of self-pity. He 
		will find -- you know, your -- the people that don't like you, the 
		critics, they're pretty predictable. Sometimes the biggest 
		disappointments will come from your so-called friends. And there will be 
		disappointments, I promise you. He'll be disappointed. On the other 
		hand, the job is so exciting and so profound that the disappointments 
		will be clearly, you know, a minor irritant compared to the --Question:It was never the 
		""loneliest office in the world"" for you?President Bush:No, not for 
		me. We had a -- people -- we -- I had a fabulous team around me of 
		highly dedicated, smart, capable people, and we had fun. I tell people 
		that, you know, some days happy, some days not so happy, every day has 
		been joyous. And people, they say, I just don't believe it to be the 
		case. Well, it is the case. Even in the darkest moments of Iraq, you 
		know, there was -- and every day when I was reading the reports about 
		soldiers losing their lives, no question there was a lot of emotion, but 
		also there was times where we could be light-hearted and support each 
		other.And I built a team of really 
		capable people who were there not to serve me, or there to serve the 
		Republicans, they were there to serve the country. And President-Elect 
		Obama will find, as he makes these tough calls and tough decisions, that 
		he'll be supported by a lot of really good people that care -- care 
		about the country, as well.John.Question:You've talked a lot about 
		your concerns over the rise of protectionism in the current --President Bush:Yes.Question:-- economic environment. 
		What do you think the future holds for that? Do you think the trend is a 
		good one or a bad one?President Bush:I hope the 
		trend is bad against protectionism. A disappointment -- not a mistake, 
		but a disappointment -- was not getting the three trade bills out of 
		Congress on Colombia, Panama and South Korea. That was a disappointment. 
		I actually thought we had a shot at one time, and then I was 
		disappointed that they didn't move out of the House.And I am concerned about 
		protectionism. In tough economic times, the temptation is to say, well, 
		let's just throw up barriers and protect our own and not compete. That 
		was the sentiment, by the way, that was in place during decent economic 
		times. After all, we got CAFTA out of the Congress by one vote. And it 
		would be a huge mistake if we become a protectionist nation.And that might be a good 
		thing for the Bush center to do at SMU, is to remind people about the 
		benefits of free and fair trade -- benefits for our own workers, 
		benefits for workers overseas, and benefits when it comes to promoting 
		development and helping lift people out of poverty, in particularly, 
		third world countries. The best way to enhance economic growth in a 
		third world country and to give people a chance to realize a better 
		future is through trade. It's been proven, it's a fact. And I'm hopeful 
		that the country doesn't slip into protectionist policy.April, yes, ma'am.Question:Thank you, Mr. President.President Bush:Yes. You were 
		sound asleep back there, so I decided --Question:No, I wasn't. There was a 
		whole clear row before me. I thought you were going to go there. But 
		either way, thanks for the surprise.Mr. President, on New 
		Orleans, you basically talked about a moment ago about the photo 
		opportunity. But let's talk about what you could have done to change the 
		situation for the city of New Orleans to be further along in 
		reconstruction than where it is now. And also, when you came -- or began 
		to run for the Oval Office about nine years ago or so, the James Byrd 
		dragging death was residue on your campaign. And now at this time, 2009, 
		we have the first black President. Could you tell us what you have seen 
		on the issues of race, as you see it from the Oval Office?President Bush:Sure, thanks. 
		First of all, we did get the $121 billion, more or less, passed, and 
		it's now being spent. Secondly, the school system is improving 
		dramatically. Thirdly, people are beginning to move back into homes. 
		This storm was a devastating storm, April, that required a lot of 
		energy, a lot of focus and a lot of resources to get New Orleans up and 
		running.And has the reconstruction 
		been perfect? No. Have things happened fairly quickly? Absolutely. And 
		is there more to be done? You bet there is.Question:What more needs to be 
		done?President Bush:Well, more 
		people need to get in their houses. More people need to have their own 
		home there. But the systems are in place to continue the reconstruction 
		of New Orleans.People said, well, the 
		federal response was slow. Don't tell me the federal response was slow 
		when there was 30,000 people pulled off roofs right after the storm 
		passed. I remember going to see those helicopter drivers, Coast Guard 
		drivers, to thank them for their courageous efforts to rescue people off 
		roofs. Thirty thousand people were pulled off roofs right after the 
		storm moved through. It's a pretty quick response.Could things have been done 
		better? Absolutely. Absolutely. But when I hear people say, the federal 
		response was slow, then what are they going to say to those chopper 
		drivers, or the 30,000 that got pulled off the roofs?The other part of the -- 
		look, I was affected by the TV after the elections -- when I saw people 
		saying, I never thought I would see the day that a black person would be 
		elected President, and a lot of the people had tears streaming down 
		their cheeks when they said it. And so I am -- I am -- consider myself 
		fortunate to have a front-row seat on what is going to be an historic 
		moment for the country. President-Elect Obama's election does speak 
		volumes about how far this country has come when it comes to racial 
		relations. But there's still work to do. There's always going to be work 
		to do to deal with people's hearts.And so I'm looking forward 
		to it, really am. I think it's going to be -- it's going to be an 
		amazing -- amazing moment.Michael Allen -- yes, 
		Michael Allen.Question:Mr. President --President Bush:Who would be 
		you.Q Mr. President, often 
		Presidents go -- leave here; they say they're going to decompress, and 
		then pretty soon they're right back in their office. I wonder how 
		quickly you think you're going to be back at it, whether it's writing 
		your book, whether it's speaking, whether it's traveling, whether it's 
		--President Bush:You know, 
		Mike, I don't know. Probably the next day. I'm a Type A personality, you 
		know, I just -- I just can't envision myself, you know, the big straw 
		hat and Hawaiian shirt sitting on some beach.Question:No one else can, either.President Bush:So -- 
		Particularly since I quit drinking. Anyway, so I predict to you that -- 
		first of all, I'm not sure what to expect. For the last eight years I've 
		had a national security briefing every day but Sunday. And when you get 
		a national security briefing, it is a reminder of the responsibilities 
		of the job. It's just a daily reminder about what may or may not happen.The interesting thing about 
		this job, by the way, is it's one thing to deal with the expected, what 
		you anticipate; the real challenge is to be in a position to deal with 
		the unexpected. And that's why those intel briefings are so important, 
		because there is -- there's an awareness in the briefings by the analyst 
		to try to help anticipate problems. And of course you hope they don't 
		arise, but you better be prepared when they do.And that in itself creates a 
		-- you know, gets your attention, when you start thinking about what 
		could happen. And the key there, of course, is that -- to take these 
		different analyses seriously, and then have a structure so that your 
		team will be in a position to analyze and then lay out potential avenues 
		for the President -- from which the President can choose.I say all that because 
		that's -- this has been -- this notion about being briefed and thinking 
		about this issue or that issue has been just a part of my life for eight 
		years. People say, well, there you are in Crawford on vacation. You 
		never escape the presidency. It travels with you everywhere you go. And 
		there's not a moment where you don't think about being President -- 
		unless you're riding mountain bikes as hard as you possibly can, trying 
		to forget for the moment.And so I wake up in Crawford 
		Tuesday morning -- I mean, Wednesday morning, and I suspect I'll make 
		Laura coffee and go get it for her. And it's going to be a different 
		feeling. And I can't -- it's kind of like -- I'll report back after I 
		feel it.Last question. Ann -- since 
		you've been there from day one.Question:Thank you -- and I wanted 
		to ask you about day one. You arrived here wanting to be a uniter, not a 
		divider. Do you think Barack Obama can be a uniter, not a divider? Or is 
		-- with the challenges for any President and the unpopular decisions, is 
		it impossible for any President to be uniter, not a divider?President Bush:I hope the 
		tone is different for him than it has been for me. I am disappointed by 
		the tone in Washington, D.C. I tried to do my part by not engaging in 
		the name-calling and -- and by the way, needless name-calling. I have 
		worked to be respectful of my opponents on different issues.There -- we did find some 
		good common ground on a variety of issues -- No Child Left Behind, 
		Medicare/prescription drugs, PEPFAR, in the end, the funding for troops 
		in Iraq. Tax cuts, to a certain extent, got some bipartisan votes on 
		them. There had been areas where we were able to work together. It's 
		just the rhetoric got out of control at times --Question:Why?President Bush:I don't know 
		why. You need to ask those who -- those who used the words they used. As 
		I say, it's not the first time it's ever happened -- as I think I 
		answered that to Jim, there. It's happened throughout our history. And I 
		would hope that, frankly, for the sake of the system itself, that if 
		people disagree with President-Elect Obama, they treat him with respect. 
		I worry about people looking at our system and saying, why would I want 
		to go up there and work in that kind of environment?And so I wish him all the 
		best. And no question he'll be -- there will be critics. And there 
		should be. We all should welcome criticism on different policy -- it's 
		the great thing about our democracy; people have a chance to express 
		themselves. I just hope the tone is respectful. He deserves it -- and so 
		does the country.It has been a honor to work 
		with you. I meant what I said when I first got up here. I wish you all 
		the very best.

88,17 January 2009,>American Rhetoric: George W. Bush - Farewell Address to the Nati,"Thank you.Fellow citizens, 
		for eight years it has been my honor to serve as your President. The 
		first decade of this new century has been a period of consequence, a 
		time set apart. Tonight, with a thankful 
		heart, I have asked for a final opportunity to share some thoughts on 
		the journey that we have traveled together and the future of our nation.Five days from now, the 
		world will witness the vitality of American democracy. In a tradition 
		dating back to our founding, the presidency will pass to a successor 
		chosen by you, the American people. Standing on the steps of the Capitol 
		will be a man whose history reflects the enduring promise of our land. 
		This is a moment of hope and pride for our whole nation. And I join all 
		Americans in offering best wishes to President-elect Obama, his wife, 
		Michelle, and their two beautiful girls.Tonight, I am filled with 
		gratitude to Vice President Cheney and members of my Administration; to 
		Laura, who brought joy to this house and love to my life; to our 
		wonderful daughters, Barbara and Jenna; to my parents, whose examples 
		have provided strength for a lifetime. And above all, I thank the 
		American people for the trust you have given me. I thank you for the 
		prayers that have lifted my spirits. And I thank you for the countless 
		acts of courage, generosity, and grace that I have witnessed these past 
		eight years.This evening, my thoughts 
		return to thefirst night I addressed you from this House, September 
		the 11th, 
		2001. That morning, terrorists took nearly 3,000 lives in the worst 
		attack on America sincePearl Harbor. I rememberstanding in the rubble 
		of the World Trade Centerthree days later, surrounded by rescuers who 
		had been working around the clock. I remember talking to brave souls who 
		charged through smoke-filled corridors at the Pentagon and to husbands 
		and wives whose loved ones became heroes aboardFlight 93. I remember 
		Arlene Howard, who gave me her fallen son's police shield as a reminder 
		of all that was lost. And I still carry his badge. As the years passed, most 
		Americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9/11. 
		But I never did. Every morning, I received a briefing on the threats to 
		our nation. I vowed to do everything in my power to keep us safe.Over the past seven years, a 
		new Department of Homeland Security has been created. The military, the 
		intelligence community, and the FBI have been transformed. Our nation is 
		equipped with new tools to monitor the terrorists' movements, freeze 
		their finances, and break up their plots. And with strong allies at our 
		side, we have taken the fight to the terrorists and those who support 
		them. Afghanistan has gone from a nation where the Taliban harbored Al 
		Qaeda and stoned women in the streets to a young democracy that is 
		fighting terror and encouraging girls to go to school. Iraq has gone 
		from a brutal dictatorship and a sworn enemy of America to an Arab 
		democracy at the heart of the Middle East and a friend of the United 
		States.There's legitimate debate 
		about many of these decisions. But there can be little debate about the 
		results. America has gone more than seven years without another 
		terrorist attack on our soil. This is a tribute to those who toil night 
		and day 
		to keep us safe -- law enforcement officers, intelligence 
		analysts, homeland security and diplomatic personnel, and the men and 
		women of the United States Armed Forces.Our nation is blessed to 
		have citizens who volunteer to defend us in this time of danger. I have 
		cherished meeting these selfless patriots and their families. And America 
		owes you a debt of gratitude. And to all our men and women in uniform 
		listening tonight: There has been no higher honor than serving as your 
		Commander in Chief.The battles waged by our 
		troops are part of a broader struggle between two dramatically different 
		systems. Under one, a small band of fanatics demands total obedience to 
		an oppressive ideology, condemns women to subservience, and marks 
		unbelievers for murder. The other system is based on the conviction that 
		freedom is the universal gift of Almighty God and that liberty and 
		justice light the path to peace.This is the belief that gave 
		birth to our nation, and in the long run, advancing this belief is the 
		only practical way to protect our citizens. When people live in freedom, 
		they do not willingly choose leaders who pursue campaigns of terror. 
		When people have hope in the future, they will not cede their lives to 
		violence and extremism. So around the world, America is promoting human 
		liberty, human rights, and human dignity. We're standing with 
		dissidents and young democracies, providing AIDS medicine to dying 
		patients -- to bring dying 
		patients back to life, and sparing mothers and babies from malaria. And 
		this great republic, born alone in liberty, is leading the world toward a 
		new age when freedom belongs to all nations.For eight years, we've 
		also strived to expand opportunity and hope here at home. Across our 
		country, students are rising to meet higher standards in public schools. 
		A new Medicare prescription drug benefit is bringing peace of mind to 
		seniors and the disabled. Every taxpayer pays lower income taxes. The 
		addicted and suffering are finding new hope through face -- faith-based 
		programs. Vulnerable human life is better protected. Funding for our 
		veterans has nearly doubled. America's air and water and lands are 
		measurably cleaner. And the Federal bench includes wise new members like 
		Justice Sam Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts.When challenges to our 
		prosperity emerged, we rose to meet them. Facing the prospect of a 
		financial collapse, we took decisive measures to safeguard our economy. 
		These are very tough times for hardworking families, but the toll would 
		be far worse if we had not acted. All Americans are in this together. 
		And together, with determination and hard work, we will restore our 
		economy to the path of growth. We will show the world once again the 
		resilience of America's free enterprise system.Like all who have held this 
		office before me, I have experienced setbacks. And there are things I would 
		do differently if given the chance. Yet I've always acted with the 
		best interests of our country in mind. I have followed my conscience and 
		done what I thought was right. You may not agree with some of the tough 
		decisions I have made. But I hope you can agree that I was willing to 
		make the tough decisions.The decades ahead will bring 
		more hard choices for our country, and there are some guiding principles 
		that shape -- should shape our course. While our nation is safer than it was 
		seven years ago, the gravest threat to our people remains another 
		terrorist attack. Our enemies are patient and determined to strike 
		again. America did nothing to seek or deserve this conflict, but we have 
		been given solemn responsibilities, and we must meet them. We must 
		resist complacency. We must keep our resolve. And we must never let down 
		our guard.At the same time, we must 
		continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose. In the 
		face of threats from abroad, it can be tempting to seek comfort by 
		turning inward. But we must reject isolationism and its companion, 
		protectionism. Retreating behind our borders would only invite danger. 
		In the 21st century, security and prosperity at home depend on the 
		expansion of liberty abroad. If America does not lead the cause of 
		freedom, that cause will not be led.As we address these 
		challenges -- and others we cannot foresee tonight -- America must 
		maintain our moral clarity. I've often spoken to you about good and 
		evil, and this has made some uncomfortable. But good and evil are present in 
		this world, and between the two there can be no compromise. Murdering 
		the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time, everywhere. 
		Freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right. This 
		nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth. We must always 
		be willing to act in their defense and to advance the cause of peace.President Thomas Jefferson 
		once wrote, ""I like the dreams of the future better than the history of 
		the past."" As I leave the House he occupied two centuries ago, I share 
		that optimism. America is a young country, full of vitality, constantly 
		growing and renewing itself. And even in the toughest times, we lift our 
		eyes to the broad horizon ahead.I have confidence in the 
		promise of America because I know the character of our people. This is a 
		nation that inspires immigrants to risk everything for the dream of 
		freedom. This is a nation where citizens show calm in times of danger 
		and compassion in the face of suffering. We see examples of America's 
		character all around us. And Laura and I have invited some of them to 
		join us in the White House this evening.We see America's character 
		in Dr. Tony Recasner, a principal who opened a new charter school from 
		the ruins of Hurricane Katrina. We see it inJulio Medina, a former 
		inmate who leads a faith-based program to help prisoners returning to 
		society. We see it inStaff Sergeant Aubrey McDade, who charged into an 
		ambush in Iraq and rescued three of his fellow Marines.We see America's character 
		inBill Krissoff, a surgeon from California. His son Nathan, a Marine, 
		gave his life in Iraq. When I met Dr. Krissoff and his family, he 
		delivered some surprising news: He told me he wanted to join the Navy 
		Medical Corps in honor of his son. This good man was 60 years old -- 18 
		years above the age limit. But his petition for a waiver was granted, 
		and for the past year he has trained in battlefield medicine. Lieutenant 
		Commander Krissoff could not be here tonight, because he will soon 
		deploy to Iraq, where he will help save America's wounded warriors and 
		uphold the legacy of his fallen son.In citizens like these, we 
		see the best of our country -- resilient and hopeful, caring and strong. 
		These virtues give me an unshakable faith in America. We have faced 
		danger and trial, and there's more ahead. But with the courage of our 
		people and confidence in our ideals, this great nation willnever tire, 
		never falter, and never fail.It has been the privilege of 
		a lifetime to serve as your President. There have been good days and 
		tough days. But every day I have been inspired by the greatness of our 
		country and uplifted by the goodness of our people. I have been blessed 
		to represent this nation we love. And I will always be honored to carry 
		a title that means more to me than any other: citizen of the United 
		States of America.And so, my fellow Americans, 
		for the final time: Good night.May God bless this House and 
		our next President.And may God bless you and 
		our wonderful country.Thank you.",thank citizen eight year honor serve president first decade new century period consequence time set apart tonight thankful heart ask final opportunity share thought

89,10 September 2011,>American Rhetoric: George W. Bush - Final Radio Addre,"Good morning. For the last 
		eight years, I have had the honor of speaking to the American people 
		Saturday mornings through this radio address. In hundreds of broadcasts, 
		I have talked to you about important issues affecting our security and 
		our prosperity. And today, in my final address, I want to send a simple 
		and heartfelt message: Thank you.Eight years ago, Laura and I 
		left our home in Texas to come to Washington. Through two terms in the 
		White House, we have been blessed by your kind words and generous 
		prayers. We have been inspired by those of you who reach out to feed the 
		hungry, clothe the needy, and care for the sick. We have been moved by 
		the courage and devotion of those of you who wear the uniform. Serving 
		as your President has been an incredible honor.Like every individual who 
		has held this office before me, I have experienced setbacks. There are 
		things I would do differently if given the chance. Yet I've always acted 
		with the best interests of our country in mind. I have followed my 
		conscience and done what I thought was right. You may not agree with 
		some tough decisions I have made. But I hope you can agree that I was 
		willing to make the tough decisions.The decades ahead will bring 
		more hard choices for our country, and there are some guiding principles 
		that should shape our course. While our Nation is safer than it was 
		seven years ago, the gravest threat to our people remains another 
		terrorist attack. Our enemies are patient, and determined to strike 
		again. America did nothing to seek or deserve this conflict. But we have 
		been given solemn responsibilities, and we must meet them. We must 
		resist complacency. We must keep our resolve. And we must never let down 
		our guard.At the same time, we must 
		continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose. In the 
		face of threats from abroad, it can be tempting to seek comfort by 
		turning inward. But we must reject isolationism and its companion, 
		protectionism. Retreating behind our borders would only invite danger. 
		In the 21st century, security and prosperity at home depend on the 
		expansion of liberty abroad. If America does not lead the cause of 
		freedom, that cause will not be led.As we address these 
		challenges -- and others we cannot foresee today -- America must 
		maintain our moral clarity. I've often spoken to you about good and 
		evil. This has made some uncomfortable. But good and evil are present in 
		this world, and between the two there can be no compromise. Murdering 
		the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time, everywhere. 
		Freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right. This 
		nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth. We must always 
		be willing to act in their defense -- and to advance the cause of peace.Eight years ago, on a cold 
		January morning, I stood on the steps of the United States Capitol, 
		placed my hand on the Bible, and swore a sacred oath to defend our 
		people and our Constitution. On that day, I spoke of ""our nation's grand 
		story of courage and its simple dream of dignity."" Next week, my term of 
		service will come to an end -- but that story and that dream will 
		continue.On Tuesday, Laura and I will 
		join all Americans in offering our best wishes to President Obama, his 
		wife Michelle, and their two beautiful girls. And later that day, we 
		will return to the love of family and friends in Texas. I will depart 
		office proud of my Administration's record. And I will spend the rest of 
		my life grateful for the opportunity to have served as President of the 
		greatest nation on Earth.Thank you for listening.",good morning last eight year honor speak american people saturday morning radio address hundred broadcast talk important issue affect security prosperity today final address want send simple heartfelt message thank year ago laura leave home texas come washington two term white house bless kind word generous prayer inspire reach fee hungry clothe needy care sick move courage devotion wear uniform serve president incredible every individual hold office experience setback thing would differently give chance yet always act best interest country mind follow conscience do think right may agree tough decision make hope agree will make tough decade ahead bring hard choice country guide principle shape course nation safer seven year ago gravest threat people remain another terrorist attack enemy patient determine strike america nothing seek deserve conflict give solemn responsibility must meet must resist complacency must keep resolve must never let time must continue engage world confidence clear purpose face threat abroad tempt seek comfort turn inward must reject isolationism companion protectionism retreat behind border would invite danger century security prosperity home depend expansion liberty abroad america lead cause freedom cause address challenge others foresee today america must maintain moral clarity often speak good evil make uncomfortable good evil present world two compromise murder innocent advance ideology wrong every time everywhere free people oppression despair eternally right nation must continue speak justice truth must always will act defense advance cause year ago cold january morning stand step unite state capitol place hand bible swear sacred oath defend people constitution day speak nation grand story courage simple dream dignity next week term service come end story dream tuesday laura join american offer best wish president obama wife michelle two beautiful girl later day return love family friend texas depart office proud administration record spend rest life grateful opportunity serve president greatest nation listen,morning year honor people morning radio address talk issue security prosperity today address simple heartfelt message year home texas washington term house bless kind word prayer inspire fee clothe needy care move courage devotion serve president individual hold office experience setback thing chance interest country conscience right decision hope agree decade choice country guide principle shape course nation year threat people attack enemy patient determine strike nothing seek deserve conflict solemn responsibility complacency resolve time world confidence face threat comfort inward isolationism companion protectionism retreat border century security prosperity home expansion liberty lead cause freedom cause address challenge others today america clarity evil evil world compromise murder advance ideology time people despair nation justice truth defense advance cause year morning step state capitol place hand swear defend people day nation story courage dream dignity week term service end story dream tuesday offer president wife girl day family depart office administration record life opportunity president nation listen
90,25 April 2013,">American Rhetoric: George W. Bush -- United Flight 93 Memorial Dedication 
Speech","Thank you, very much. Mr. Secretary, thank you 
			very much. Mr. Vice President, Dr. Biden, President Clinton, Mr. 
			Speaker, members of Congress, my friends Tommy Franks and Tom Ridge, 
			thank you for helping raise the money for this memorial. Members of 
			the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation, all  
			those who supported this memorial, but most importantly, the 
			families ofFlight 93.Laura and I are honored to join you in 
			dedicating this memorial to the heroes of Flight 93.When the sun rose in the 
			Pennsylvania sky ten years ago tomorrow, it was a peaceful September 
			morning. By the time it set nearly 3,000 people were gone. The most 
			lives lost on American soil in a single day since thebattle of 
			Antietam.With the distance of a 
			decade, 9/11 can feel like a part of a different era. But for the 
			families of the men and women stolen, some of whom join us today, 
			that day will never feel like history. The memory of that morning is 
			fresh and so is the pain. America shares your grief. We pray for 
			your comfort and we honor your loved ones.September the 11th, 2001, 
			innocent men and women went to work at the World Trade Center. They 
			reported for duty at the Pentagon. They boarded American Flights 11 
			and 77, United Flights 93 and 175. They did nothing to provoke or deserve 
			the deliberate act of murder that al Qaeda carried out.One of the lessons of 
			9/11 is that evil is real, and so is courage. When the planes struck 
			the World Trade Center, firefighters and police officers charged up 
			the stairs into the flames. As the towers neared collapse, they 
			continued the rescue efforts.Ultimately, more than 
			400 police officers and firefighters gave their lives. Among them 
			was the chief of the New York City Fire Department,Peter Gancy. As a 
			colleague put it, he would never ask anyone to do something he 
			didn't do himself.The Pentagon service 
			members and civilians pulled friends and strangers from burning 
			rubble. One special forces soldier recalls reaching through a cloud 
			of smoke in search of the wounded. As he entered one room, he prayed 
			to find someone alive. He discovered a severely burned woman and 
			carried her to safety. They later met in the hospital, where she explained 
			that she'd been praying for rescue. She called him her guardian angel.And then there's the 
			extraordinary story we commemorate here. Aboard United Airlines 
			Flight 93 were college students from California, an iron worker from 
			New Jersey, veterans of the Korean War and World War II, citizens of 
			Germany and Japan, a pilot who had rearranged his schedule so that 
			he could take his wife on a vacation to celebrate their anniversary.When the passengers and 
			crew realized the plane had been hijacked, they reported the news 
			calmly. When they learned that the terrorists had crashed other 
			planes into targets on the ground, they accepted greater 
			responsibilities. In the back of the cabin, the passengers gathered 
			to devise a strategy.At the moment America's 
			democracy was under attack, our citizens defied their captors by 
			holding a vote. The choice they made would cost them their lives, 
			and they knew it. Many passengers called 
			their loved ones to say goodbye; then hung up to perform their final 
			act. One said, ""They're getting ready to break into the cockpit. I 
			have to go. I love you."" Another said, ""It's up to us. I think we 
			can do it.""In one of the most 
			stirring accounts,Todd Beamer, a father of two with a pregnant wife 
			with a home in New Jersey, asked the air phone operator to join him in 
			reciting the Lord's Prayer. Then he helped lead the charge to the 
			front of the plane with the 
			words ""Let's roll.""With their selfless act, 
			the men and women who stormed the cockpit lived out the words, 
			""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life 
			for his friends.""1And with their brave decision, they launched the 
			first counter offensive of the war on terror. The most likely target 
			of the hijacked plane was the United States Capitol. We'll never 
			know how many innocent people might have been lost, but we do know 
			this: Americans are alive today because the passengers and crew of 
			Flight 93 chose to act, and our nation will be forever grateful.The 40 souls who 
			perished on the plane left a great deal behind. They left spouses 
			and children and grandchildren who miss them dearly. They left 
			successful businesses and promising careers and a lifetime of dreams 
			that they will never have the chance to fulfill. They left something else: a legacy of bravery and selflessness that will always inspire 
			America.For generations people 
			will study the flight, the story of Flight 93. They will learn that 
			individual choices make a difference, that love and sacrifice can 
			triumph over evil and hate, and that what happened above this 
			Pennsylvania field ranks among the most courageous acts in American 
			history.The memorial we 
			dedicate today will ensure our nation always remembers those lost 
			here on 9/11. But we have a duty beyond memory. We have a duty 
			beyond honoring. We have a duty to live our lives in a way that 
			upholds the ideals for which the men and women gave their lives, to 
			build a living memorial to their courage and sacrifice. We have a 
			duty to find common purpose as a nation.In the days after 9/11, 
			the response came like a single hand over a single heart. Members of 
			Congress from both sides of the aisle gathered on the steps of the 
			capitol and sang ""God bless America."" Neighbors reached out to 
			neighbors of all backgrounds and beliefs.The past decade, our 
			country has been tested by natural disaster, economic turmoil, 
			anxieties and challenges here at home and abroad. There have been 
			spirited debates along the way. It's the essence of democracy. But 
			Americans have never been defined by our disagreements. Whatever 
			challenges we face today and in the future, we must never lose faith 
			in our ability to meet them together. We must never allow our 
			differences to harden into divisions.Second, we have a duty 
			to remain engaged in the world. 9/11 proved that the conditions in 
			the country on the other side of the world can have an impact on our 
			own streets. It may be tempting to think it doesn't matter what 
			happens to a villager in Afghanistan or a child in Africa, but the 
			temptation of isolation is deadly wrong.World repression and anger 
			and resentment will be a never ending source of violence and 
			threats. A world of dignity and liberty and hope will be safer and 
			better for all. The surest way to move toward that vision is for the 
			United States of America to lead the cause of freedom.Finally, we each have a 
			duty to serve a cause larger than ourselves. The passengers aboard 
			Flight 93 set an example that inspires us all. Many have followed 
			their path of service by donating blood or mentoring a child or 
			volunteering in desperate corners of the earth. Some have devoted 
			their careers to analyzing intelligence or protecting our borders 
			and securing our skies. Others have made the noble choice to defend 
			our nation in battle.For 10 years, our troops 
			have risked and given their lives to prevent our enemies from 
			attacking America again. They've kept us safe; they have made us 
			proud; and they have upheld the spirit of service shown by the 
			passengers on Flight 93.Many years ago in 1863, 
			another President cameto dedicate a memorial sitein this state. He 
			told his audience that:In a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we 
			cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. For the brave souls 
			who struggled there, it consecrated it far above our poor power to 
			add or detract.He added, ""The world will 
			little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never 
			forget what they did here.""So it is with Flight 93.For as long as this memorial stands, we will remember what the men 
			and women aboard the plane did here. We'll pay tribute to the 
			courage they showed, the sacrifice they made, and the lives they 
			spared.The United States will never forget.May God bless you all.",thank much secretary thank much vice president biden president clinton speaker member congress friend tommy frank tom ridge thank

91,28 August 2015,">George W. Bush - Bush Presidential Library Dedication Address - American 
Rhetor","Thank you all. Please be 
			seated.Oh, happy days. I want to 
			thank you all for coming. Laura and are I thrilled to have so many 
			friends, I mean a lot of friends here to celebrate this special day.There was a time in my 
			life when I wasnt likely to be found at a library, much less found 
			one. Beautiful building has my name above the door -- but it belongs to 
			you. It honors the cause we 
			serve and the country we share. For eight years, you gave me the 
			honor of serving as your President. And today Im proud to dedicate this 
			center to the American people.I am very grateful to 
			President Obama and Michelle for making this trip. Unlike the other 
			Presidents here, hes actually got a job. President, thank you foryour kind wordsand for leading the nation 
			we all love.I appreciate my fellow 
			members of the former Presidents Club; 42, 41 and 39.1I want to 
			thank you all for your kind words and the example you have set.Alexander Hamilton once 
			worried about ex-Presidents wandering among the people like 
			discontented ghosts. Actually, I think we seem pretty happy. One 
			reason is that we have wonderful first ladies at our side. Hillary and Roslyn, 
			thank you for your service and your generosity. Mother and Laura, 
			you know how I feel. Condi [Rice] introduced the world leaders with whom I 
			had the privilege to serve. You're good friends and 
			Im honored to have you here in the promised land.I want to welcome 
			the members of Congress, Mr. Speaker, appreciate you coming; and 
			the diplomatic corps, I know you will all be happy to hear that this speech 
			is a lot shorter than the State of the Union.I thank the governors, 
			governor from our own home state2and other governors, mayors, state and local 
			officials who have joined us.I welcome members of my cabinet, the 
			White House staff and administration, especially Vice President Dick 
			Cheney. From the day I asked Dick to run with me, he served with 
			loyalty, principle and strength -- proud to call you friend.History is going to show 
			that I served with great people; a talented, dedicated, intelligent 
			men -- 
			team of men and women who love our nation as much as I do. I want 
			to thank the people who have made this project a success. PresidentGerald Turnerruns a fantastic university. A university with active 
			trustees, dedicated faculty and a student body that is awesome.I want to thankDavid Ferriero,Alan Lowe, and the professionals at theNational 
			Archives and Records Administrationwho have taken on a major task 
			and I am confident you all will handle it.I appreciate the 
			architects, landscapers, and designers, especially Bob Stern,Michael Van Valkenburghand Dan Murphy. I want to thank the folks ofManhattan 
			Constructionas well as all the workers who built a fine facility 
			that will stand the test of time.I thank the fantastic 
			team of theGeorge W. Bush Center, headed by Mark Langdale and Jim 
			Glassman and my long time pal Donnie Evans. Much to the delight, 
			much to the delight of the folks who worked on this project, we have 
			raised enough money to pay our bills. We have -- We have over 
			300-thousand contributors from all 50 states and Laura and I thank 
			you from the bottom of our hearts.This is the first time 
			in American history that parents have seen their sons Presidential 
			library. Mother, I promise to keep my area clean. You know, Barbara 
			Bush taught me to live life to the fullest, to laugh a lot, and to 
			speak my mind -- a trait that has 
			sometimes got us both into trouble. Dad taught me how to be a 
			President. Before that he showed me how to be a man; and 41 it is 
			awesome that you are here today.I welcome -- I welcome my dear 
			brothers and sister as well as in-laws, cousins, nieces, uncles, all 
			of you for joining us. Our family has meant more to me than anything 
			and I thank you for making it so.Not so long ago, this 
			campus was home to a beautiful West Texan named Laura Welch. When 
			she earned her degree in library science, Im not sure this day is 
			exactly what she had in mind. Shes been a source of 
			strength and support and inspiration ever since we met in the ONeals 
			backyard in Midland, Texas. One of the joys of the Presidency was 
			watching Laura serve as First Lady. The American people rightly love 
			her and so do I.Lauras going to be even 
			better at her next role: grandmother. It was a joy -- I cant tell 
			you what a joy it was to hold little Mila. And I am really happy 
			that Milas mother and father, Jenna and Henry, could make it here 
			today. Thank you all for coming. So if you dont have to do in the 
			morning, tune in to the Today Show. Jenna is a correspondent, thereby continuing the 
			warm relations the Bush family has with the national press. And Im really proud of 
			Barbara, who is with us, for her incredible work to serve others and 
			save lives.Today marks a major 
			milestone in a journey that began 20 years ago when I announced my 
			campaign for Governor of Texas. Some of you were there that day. I 
			mean a lot of you were there that day. I picture you looking a little 
			younger. You probably pictured me with a little less gray hair. In 
			politics, you learn who your real friends are. And our friends have 
			stood with us every step of the way. And todays the day to give you 
			a proper thanks.In democracy, the 
			purpose of public office is not to fulfill personal ambition. 
			Elected officials must serve a cause greater themselves. The 
			political winds blow left and right, polls rise and fall, supporters 
			come and go. But in the end, leaders are defined by the convictions 
			they hold. And my deepest conviction, the guiding principle of the 
			Administration, is that the United States of America must strive to 
			expand the reach of freedom.I believe that freedom 
			is a gift from God and the hope of every human heart.Freedom 
			inspired our Founders and preserved our union through civil war and 
			secured the promise of civil rights. Freedom sustains dissidents 
			bound by chains, believers huddled in underground churches, and 
			voters who risked their lives to cast their ballots. Freedom 
			unleashes creativity, rewards innovation, and replaces poverty with 
			prosperity. And ultimately freedom lights the path to peace. Freedom 
			brings responsibility.Independence from the 
			State does not mean isolation from each other. A free society 
			thrives when neighbors help neighbors, and the strong protect the 
			weak, and public policies promote private compassion. As President, 
			I tried to act on these principles everyday. It wasnt always easy 
			and it certainly wasnt always popular. One of the benefits of 
			freedom is that people can disagree. Its fair to say I created 
			plenty of opportunities to exercise that right. But when future 
			generations come to this library and study this Administration, 
			theyre going to find out that we stayed true to our convictions:That we expanded freedom 
			at home by raising standards at schools  and lowering taxes for 
			everybody.That we liberated nations from dictatorship and freed 
			people from AIDS.And thatwhen our freedom came under attack, we made 
			the tough decisions required to keep the American people safe.The same principles 
			defined the mission of thePresidential Center. Im retired from 
			politics -- happily so, I might add -- but not from public service. 
			Well use our influence to help more children start life with a 
			quality education; to help more Americans find jobs and economic 
			opportunity; to help more countries overcome poverty and disease; to help 
			more people in every part of the world live in freedom.Well work to empower 
			women around the world to transform their countries; stand behind the 
			courageous men and women who have stepped forward to wear the 
			uniform of the United States to defend our flag and our freedoms here 
			at home. Ultimately, the success of a nation depends on the 
			character of its citizens.Mr. President, I had the 
			privilege to see that character up close. I saw it in the first 
			responders who charged up the stairs into the flames to save 
			peoples lives from burning towers. I saw it in theVirginia Tech 
			professor who barricaded his classroom door with his bodyuntil his 
			students escaped to safety. I saw it in the people in New Orleans 
			who made homemade boats to rescue their neighbors from the floods. I 
			saw it in the service members who laid down their lives to keep 
			our country safe -- and to make other nations free.Franklin Roosevelt once 
			described the dedication of a library as an act of faith. I dedicate 
			this library with an unshakeable faith in the future of our country.It was the honor of a lifetime to lead a country as brave and as noble

92,12 July 2016,>George W. Bush - Hurricane Katrina 10 Year Anniversary Spee,"Thank you all.  As has been mentioned,in 2006 Laura and I came heretoWarren Easton Charter High Schoola year after Katrina hit, and we are 
		honored and pleased to be back in the 10th anniversary of that 
		devastating storm. I cant think of a better place to come here in New 
		Orleans, except for some of the restaurants.The slogan that guided the 
		school when we first visited is true today:  We believe in success. 
		 And because of that success, that schools like this have achieved, 
		youve given all Americans reason to believe that New Orleans is back 
		and better than ever.Mr. Mayor, thank you for your hospitality.  You and the First Lady have 
		been so gracious to us, and we want to thank you for your leadership.  
		If enthusiasm and a good strategy counts, New Orleans is going to be -- 
		is in good hands.  
		And we thank you very much.By the way, I do bring greetings from one of the co-chairmen of theBush 
		Katrina Fund: [President George H.W. Bush] 41.  He had one of the great lines of all time.  He said, 
		Who would have thought getting out of bed at age 91 would be more 
		dangerous than jumping out of an airplane at age 90?I want to thank David Garland, President of the Warren Easton Charter 
		Foundation Board.  I want to thank all the folks who have shown up.  As 
		Laura said, we had a roundtable discussion.  Many of our friends were 
		there, people we worked with.  I think ofNorman Francisfor example, 
		one of the great leaders of New Orleans, one of the great minds of New 
		Orleans.In spite of the devastation, we have many fond memories.  I remember 
		sitting with[General Russel L.]Honoréon top one of those big ships, strategizing.  I 
		think you were drinking; I wasnt of course.  But its...great to see 
		you. Surely, were honored that you took time to come.  Obviously, 
		members of Congress, members of the State House, Superintendent White, 
		on and on, thank you all for coming.I really want to thank the leadership of the school and well talk about 
		them here in a minute. Although I must confess, 
		the Principal is always 
		a teacher.  So she tried to teach me how tosecond linewith the band 
		here at Warren Easton.  I -- I know she didnt say it, but she was thinking, 
		This, this boy needs a lot of work.  So were thrilled with your 
		hospitality.In a cruel twist,Hurricane Katrinabrought despair during what should 
		have been a season of hope -- the start of the new school year.  
		Students who had recently gone back to school suddenly had no school to 
		go back to.  Many had nowhere to live.  The floodwaters, as you all know 
		better than most, claimed schools and homes alike.  As Laura mentioned, 
		the stand -- the ground were on today was underwater.  All of us who are old enough 
		to remember will never forget the images of our fellow Americans amid a 
		sea of misery and ruin.  Well always remember the lives lost across the 
		Gulf Coast.  Their memories are in our hearts and I hope you pray for 
		their families.Hurricane Katrina is a story of loss beyond measure. Its also a story 
		of commitment and compassion.I hope you remember what I remember, and that 
		is 30,000 people were saved in the immediate aftermath of the storm 
		by U.S. military personnel, by Louisiana law enforcement, and by 
		citizens who volunteered.I hope you remember what I remember, and that 
		was the thousands who came here on a volunteer basis to provide food for 
		the hungry and to help find shelter for those who had no home to live 
		in.  There are people all around our country who prayed for you, many of 
		whom showed up so they could say they helped a fellow citizen who was 
		hurting.One of the groups that stepped forward to serve were the 
		educators of New Orleans.  At a time when it would have been easy to 
		walk away from the wreckage, the educators here today thought of the 
		children who would be left behind.  You understood that bringing New 
		Orleans back to life requires getting students back to school.  And even 
		though some of the educators had lost almost everything you owned, you 
		let nothing stand in your way.  Today, we celebrate the resurgence of 
		New Orleans schools. We honor the resilience of a great American city 
		whose levees gave out but whose people never gave up.Out of the devastation of Katrina, you vowed to do more than just open 
		the schools.  You vowed to challenge the status quo.  Long before the 
		great flood, too many students in this city drifted from grade to grade 
		without ever learning the skills needed for success. Parents lacked 
		choices and the power to intervene.  Principals and teachers lacked the 
		authority to chart a more hopeful course.  It was a system that stranded 
		more than 60 percent of the students failing in schools.  It was what I 
		called ""the soft bigotry of low expectations.""1The decisions made in the dark hours after Katrina sparked a decade of 
		reform.  Rather than just reopen the schools, we organized many into 
		charter schools that are independently operated but publicly accountable 
		for achieving high standards.  More than nine in ten public school 
		students in this city now call [a] charter school home.  Administrators at 
		these schools have the freedom to slice through red tape and the freedom 
		to innovate.  Parents at these schools have choices if dissatisfied.  
		And the results at these schools have been extraordinary.  The reason we 
		know is because we measure, and any attempt to undermine accountability 
		in our school system does a huge disservice to the students who go to 
		the schools in New Orleans.According tothe new report2by theCowen Institute, 
		[the] percentage in New 
		Orleans students graduating on time has soared since Katrina. 
		[The] percentage of students who attended schools that score better than the 
		state average almost doubled, and so has the percentage of students 
		meeting basic standards. And youve got to ask, Why?  It just didnt 
		happen.  A lot of it [was] structural, and a lot of it requires strong 
		leadership -- people who stared into the eye of the storm and who 
		refused to back down.  And so Laura and I are here in New Orleans to 
		remind our country about what strong leadership means, and were here to 
		salute the leaders.I think of Jenny Rious here at Warren Easton.  After Katrina, Jenny left 
		New Orleans and was forced to leave New Orleans. She started a website 
		called Warren Easton in Exile. The site reunited students scattered 
		across the country around a vision for returning to New Orleans and 
		reopening this school.  When Jenny returned to New Orleans, the first 
		place she went was not her house.  It was this school.  And as she put 
		it, I would rather see my own house burn down than this school.  Jenny 
		would give anything for Easton and today, we give teachers like hers our 
		sincere thanks.[Its] amazing what happened in this city after the storm wiped out the 
		school system.  Educational entrepreneurs decided to do something about 
		the devastation and the failure.  Ive met a lot of them when I was 
		President, and subsequent to my presidency.Neerav Kingslandis one 
		such person.  He took a leadership role at an organization called New 
		Schools for New Orleans. He worked with others to help launch dozens of 
		new schools and to turn ideas in -- to reform into reality. In other 
		words, this isn't 
		a theoretical exercise. Its important for our country to look at New 
		Orleans and realize this is an exercise of implementing a plan which 
		works.He -- He, so
		Neerav was so encouraged by what he sees here that he -- hes talking up the 
		reforms to other cities around the country.  Isnt it amazing? The 
		storm that nearly destroys New Orleans, and yet now New -- New Orleans is the 
		beacon for school reform. Neerav represent[s] the virtues that Bill Clinton 
		and I had in mind when we announced the newPresidential Leadership 
		Scholars program, and were honored that Neerav was among the first 
		class of scholars.Achieving these results took librarians who salvaged their collections 
		from watering wreckage.  Listen, I know something about librarians.  I 
		married one.  Im really proud of theLaura Bush Foundation.  Shes 
		talked about the Grants -- talked about Pam and Marshall.  These are 
		citizens who supported this Foundation who, if theyd been in New 
		Orleans, they didnt stay very long. And yet, like many around the 
		country, they care deeply about the future of this city.  I hope the 
		students here -- Im really thrilled youre here by the way and thank you 
		for staying awake.  I hope you realize the compassion of others in 
		helping you realize a good education.It turns out that every good school, a school thats succeeding -- a 
		school that' succeeding -- and 
		we know its succeeding, because we measure against other standards -- 
		requires strong principals.  And theres no doubt thatLexi Medleyis a 
		strong leader.  I love when she says -- when she says, If you fail, we fail.  The 
		students our product.  We dont believe in putting out anything but the 
		best.  In order to succeed, in order to lead properly, youve got to 
		set high goals and high expectations.  And thats what Lexi and this 
		school have done.  As you heard, this school has graduated 100 percent 
		of its seniors for the past five years.  Lexi, youve earned our 
		admiration and our gratitude, along with our best wishes for a happy 
		birthday tomorrow.Its the stories of schools like this one and others that we see a 
		determination to rebuild better than before.  And it -- it's a spirit much 
		stronger than any storm.  Its a spirit thats lifted communities laid 
		low by tornadoes or terrorist attacks.  Its a spirit that I saw in New 
		Orleans ten years ago, and that is very evident today.We see that spirit in the population that has ticked back up as families 
		settle back down.  We see it in the tourists who are drawn here not only 
		by this citys rich heritage but the new hotel rooms and restaurants.  
		We see it in the spirit inLauren LeDuff.  As Laura mentioned 
		-- Lauren mentioned -- Laura 
		and I first met her in 2006 when she was a senior at Easton.  She's 
		happy to be back at the school she loved -- She was happy to be back at 
		the school she loved at the time.  And you know what 
		she told me?  She said, I want to be a teacher.  And here she is as a 
		member of this faculty, teaching English.  I probably needed her when I 
		was in high school.  When asked how students have overcome adversity, 
		Lauren says, We teach our kids to be resilient.  Thats in the culture 
		of this city.Lauren's right.  The resilience you teach at Warren Easton is the same 
		resilience that this city showed the world in the wake of Hurricane 
		Katrina.  On this anniversary, the work of making a stronger and more 
		hopeful New Orleans goes on.  Youve achieved a lot over the last ten 
		years.  And with belief in success, and a faith in God, New Orleans will 
		achieve even more.  The darkness from a decade ago has lifted.  The 
		Crescent City has risen again.  And its best days lie ahead.Thank you for having me.1Phrase origin credited toMichael Gersonand perhaps first used

93,24 September 2016,>George W. Bush - National Museum of African-American Culture Dedication Spee,"Laura has been very much engaged inthis 
		museumfor a long time. She sits on the board. And were honored to be 
		here.My first reaction is I hope all our fellow citizens come and 
		look at this place. It is fabulous.Mr. Presidentand First Lady, Vice 
		President, Chief Justice;David [Skorton], thank 
		you very much; the board. I do want to give a shout out toLonnie [Bunch]. Its really important to understand this 
		project would not and could not have happened without his drive, his 
		energy, and his optimism.Now, as Laura mentioned 15 years ago members 
		from both part[ies] --Congressman John LewisandSam Brownback, 
		then-senator from Kansas -- informed me that they were about to introduce 
		legislation creating a new museum to share the stories and celebrate the 
		achievements of African Americans.You know, it would be fair to say 
		that the Congress and I did not always see eye to eye -- if you know what 
		I mean, Mr. President. But this is one issue where we strongly agreed. I 
		was honored tosign the bill[H.R. 
		3442] authorizing the construction of this 
		national treasure. And Im pleased it now stands where it has always 
		belonged, on theNational Mall.This museum is an important addition to 
		our country for many reasons. Here are three.First, it shows our 
		commitment to truth. A great nation does not hide its history. It faces 
		its flaws and corrects them. This museum tells the truth that a country 
		founded on the promise of liberty held millions in chains, that the 
		price of our union was Americas original sin.From the beginning, some spoke to truth -- 
		John Adams,who called slavery an ""evil of Colossal Magnitude""-- their 
		voices were not heeded, and often not heard. But they were always known 
		to a power greater than any on earth, One who loves His children and 
		meant them to be free.Second, this museum shows Americas 
		capacity to change. For centuries, slavery and segregation seemed 
		permanent, permanent parts of our national life -- but not toNat TurnerorFrederick Douglass,Harriet Tubman,Rosa Parks, orMartin Luther King 
		Jr. All answered cruelty with courage and hope.In a society governed by the people, no 
		wrong lasts forever. After struggle and sacrifice, the American people, 
		acting through the most democratic of means,amended the constitutionthat originally treated slaves as three-fifths of a person, to guarantee 
		equal protection of the laws. After a decade of struggle,civil rights 
		actsandvoting rights actswere finally enacted. Even today, the journey 
		toward justice is still not complete. But this museum will inspire us to 
		go farther and get there faster.And finally, the museum showcases the 
		talent of some of our finest Americans. The galleries celebrate not only 
		African American equality, but African American greatness. I -- I can't help 
		but note that -- [audience applause]. I cannot help but note that a huge influence in my teenage years is honored here, the 
		greatChuck Berry; or my baseball idol growing up in far West Texas, the 
		greatWillie Mays. And of course, something I never really mastered, the 
		ability to give a good speech, butThurgood Marshallsure could. And 
		some of you may know Im a fledgling painter, a struggling artist. I 
		have a new appreciation for the artists whose brilliant works are 
		displayed here, people likeRobert Duncanson,Henry Ossawa Tanner,Charles Henry Alston.Our country is better and more vibrant 
		because of their contributions and the contributions of millions of 
		African Americans. No telling of American history is neither complete 
		nor accurate without acknowledging them.The lesson of this museum is all -- that all 
		Americans share a past and a future by staying true to our principles,

94,05 December 2018,>George W. Bush Transcript of Eulogy for Fath,"Distinguished guests, including our Presidents and First Ladies, 
		government officials, foreign dignitaries, and friends; Jeb, Neil, 
		Marvin, Doro, and I and our families: Thank you all for being here.I once heard it said of man that the idea is to die young as late as 
		possible.President George W. Bush and 
		Russian President Vladimir Putin tour the coastline with Former 
		President George H. W. Bush aboard Fidelity III in Kennebunkport, Maine, 
		Sunday, July 1, 2007. White House photo by Eric DraperAt age 85, a favorite pastime ofGeorge H.W. Bushwas firing 
		up his boat, the Fidelity, and opening up the three 300 horsepower 
		engines to fly, joyfully fly, across the Atlantic with the Secret Service 
		boats straining to keep up.At age 90, George H.W. Bush parachuted out of an aircraft and landed on 
		the grounds of St. Anne's by the Sea in Kennebunkport, Maine, the church 
		where his mom was married and where he worshipped often. Mother liked to 
		say he chose the location just in case the chute didn't open.In his 90s, he took great delight when his closest pal,James A. Baker, 
		smuggled a bottle of Grey Goose vodka into his hospital room. Apparently 
		it paired well with the steak Baker had delivered from Morton's.To his very last days, dad's life was instructive. As he aged he taught 
		us how to grow with dignity, humor, and kindness. And when the Good Lord 
		finally called, how to meet Him with courage and with the joy of the 
		promise of what lies ahead.One reason dad knew how to die young is that he almost did it -- twice. 
		When he was a teenager, a staph infection nearly took his life.A few 
		years later he was alone in the Pacific on a life raft, praying that his 
		rescuers would find him before the enemy did. God answered those 
		prayers. It turned out He had other plans for George H.W. Bush.For dad's part, I think those brushes with death made him cherish the 
		gift of life, and he vowed to live every day to the fullest.Dad was always busy, a man in constant motion, but never too busy to 
		share his love of life with those around him. He taught us to love the 
		outdoors. He loved watching dogs flush a covey. He loved landing the 
		illusive striper. And once confined to a wheelchair, he seemed happiest 
		sitting in his favorite perch on the back porch at Walker's Point 
		contemplating the majesty of the Atlantic.The horizons he saw were bright and hopeful. He was a genuinely 
		optimistic man, and that optimism guided his children and made each of 
		us believe that anything was possible.He continually broadened his 
		horizons with daring decisions.He was a patriot. After high school he put college on hold and became a 
		navy fighter pilot as World War II broke out.Like many of his generation, he never talked about his service until his 
		time as a public figure forced his hand. We learned of theattack on Chichijima, the 
		mission completed, the shootdown. We learned of the death of his 
		crewmates, whom he thought about throughout his entire life. And we 
		learned of the rescue.And then another audacious decision: He moved his young family from the 
		comforts of the East coast to Odessa, Texas. He and Mom adjusted to 
		their arid surroundings quickly. He was a tolerant man. After all, he 
		was kind and neighborly to the women with whom he, Mom, and I shared a 
		bathroom in our small duplex -- even after he learned their profession, 
		ladies of the night.Dad could relate to people from all walks of life. He was an empathetic 
		man. He valued character over pedigree, and he was no cynic. He looked 
		for the good in each person and he usually found it.Dad taught us that public service is noble and necessary, that one can 
		serve with integrity and hold true to the important values like faith 
		and family. He strongly believed that it was important to give back to 
		the community and country in which one lived. He recognized that serving 
		others enriched the giver's soul. To us, his was the brightest ofa 
		thousand points of light.In victory he shared credit.
		When he lost, he shouldered the blame. He accepted that failure is a 
		part of living a full life, but taught us never to be defined by 
		failure. He showed us how setbacks can strengthen.None of his disappointments could compare with one of life's greatest 
		tragedies: the loss of a young child.
		Jeb and I were too young to remember the pain and agony he and Mom felt 
		when our three-year-old sister died. We only learned later that Dad, a man 
		of quiet faith, prayed for her daily. He was sustained by the love of 
		the Almighty and the real and enduring love of her Mom. Dad always 
		believed that one day he would hug his precious Robin again.He loved to laugh, especially at himself. He could tease and needle but 
		never out of malice. He placed great value on a good joke. That's why he 
		choseSimpson to speak.On e-mail he had a circle of friends with whom he shared or received the 
		latest jokes. His grading system for the quality of the joke was classic 
		George Bush. The rare 7s and 8s were considered huge winners, most of 
		them off-color.George Bush knew how to be a true and loyal friend. He nurtured and 
		honored many -- his many friendships with a generous and giving soul. There 
		exists thousands of handwritten notes encouraging or sympathizing or 
		thanking his friends and acquaintances.He had an enormous capacity to give of himself. Many a person would tell 
		you that Dad became a mentor and a father figure in their life. He 
		listened and he consoled. He was their friend. I think of Don Rhodes, 
		Taylor Blanton, Jim Nantz, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and perhaps the 
		unlikeliest of all, the man who defeated him, Bill Clinton. My siblings 
		and I refer to the guys in this group as brothers from other mothers.He taught us that a day was not meant to be wasted. He played golf at a 
		legendary pace. I always wonder[ed] why he insisted on speed golf. He is a 
		good golfer. Well, here's my conclusion: He played fast so that he could move on to 
		the next event, to enjoy the rest of the day, to expend his enormous 
		energy, to live it all. He was born with just two settings: full 
		throttle, then sleep.He taught us what it means to be a wonderful father, grandfather, and 
		great grandfather. He was firm in his principles and supportive as we 
		began to seek our own ways. He encouraged and comforted but never 
		steered. We tested his patience. I know I did. But he always responded 
		with the great gift of unconditional love.Last Friday when I was told he had minutes to live, I called him. The 
		guy who answered the phone, said he -- ""I think he can hear you but he hasn't 
		said anything for most of the day."" I said, ""Dad, I love you and you've 
		been a wonderful father,"" and the last words he would ever say on Earth 
		were, ""I love you, too.""To us he was close to perfect -- but not totally perfect. His short game was 
		lousy. He wasn't exactly Fred Astaire on the dance floor. The man 
		couldn't stomach vegetables,especially broccoli. And by the way, he 
		passed these genetic defects along to us.Finally, every day of his 73 years of marriage, Dad taught us all what 
		it means to be a great husband. He married his sweetheart. He adored 
		her. He laughed and cried with her. He was dedicated to her totally.In his old age dad enjoyed watching police show reruns, the volume on 
		high, all the while holding Mom's hand. After Mom died, Dad was strong, 
		but all he really wanted to do was hold Mom's hand again.Of course Dad taught me another special lesson. He showed me what it 
		means to be a President who serves with integrity, leads with courage, 
		and acts with love in his heart for the citizens of our country.When the history books are written, they will say that George H.W. Bush 
		was a great President of the United States, a diplomat of unmatched 
		skill, a Commander in Chief of formidable accomplishment, and a 
		gentleman who executed the duties of his office with dignity and honor.Inhis Inaugural 
		Addressthe 41st President of the United States said 
		this:We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger 
		bank account. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a 
		loyal friend, a loving parent, a citizen who leaves his home, his 
		neighborhood, and town better than he found it. What do we want the men 
		and women who work with us to say when we are no longer there? That we were more driven to succeed 
		than anyone around us? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had 
		gotten better and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship?Well, Dad, we're going to remember you for exactly that and much more; 
		and we're going to miss you. Your decency, sincerity, and kind soul will 
		stay with us forever.So, through our tears, let us know the blessings of 
		knowing and loving you, a great and noble man, the best father a son or 
		daughter could have. And in our grief, let us smile knowing that Dad is 
		hugging Robin and holding Mom's hand again.",distinguish guest include president first lady government official foreign dignitary friend jeb neil marvin doro family thank hear say man idea die young

95,02 May 2020,>George W. Bush A Call to Unite Video PSA (text-audio-vide,"This is a challenging and solemn time in the life of our nation and 
		world. A remorseless, invisible enemy threatens the elderly and 
		vulnerable among us, a disease that can quickly take breath and 
		life.Medical professionals are risking their own health for the health 
		of others, and we're deeply grateful.Officials at every level are setting out 
		the requirements of public health that protect us all, and we all need 
		to do our part.The disease also threatens broader damage -- 
		harm to our sense of safety, security, and community.The larger 
		challenge we share is to confront an outbreak of fear and loneliness, and it is frustrating that many of the 
		normal tools of compassion -- a hug, a touch -- can bring the opposite 
		of the good we intend.In this case, we serve our neighbor by separating 
		from them. We cannot allow physical separation to 
		become emotional isolation. This requires us to be not only 
		compassionate but creative in our outreach; and people across the 
		nation are using the tools of technology in the cause of solidarity.In this time of testing, we need to 
		remember a few things:First, let us remember we have faced times 
		of testing before. Following9/11, I saw a great nation rise as one to 
		honor the brave, to grieve with the grieving, and to embrace unavoidable 
		new duties. And I have no doubt -- none at all -- that this spirit of 
		service and sacrifice is alive and well in America.Second, let us remember that empathy and 
		simple kindness are essential, powerful tools of national recovery. Even 
		at an appropriate social distance, we can find ways to be present in the 
		lives of others -- to ease their anxiety and share their burdens.Third, let's remember that the suffering we 
		experience as a nation does not fall evenly. In the days to come, it 
		will be especially important to care in practical ways for the elderly, the ill, and the 
		unemployed.Finally, let us remember how small our 
		differences are in the face of this shared threat.In the final analysis, we are not partisan 
		combatants. We are human beings, equally vulnerable and equally 
		wonderful in the sight of God.We rise or fall together -- and we are 
		determined to rise.God bless you all.Audio Note: AR-XE = American Rhetoric Extreme EnhancementPage Created: 5/4/20U.S. Copyright Status:Text, Audio, Video = Uncertain.Image = Fair Use.Top 100 American SpeechesOnline Speech BankMovie Speeches© Copyright 2001-Present.American Rhetoric.HTML transcription by Michael E.

96,11 September 2021,>George W. Bush - Flight 93 9/11 20 Year Memorial Addre,"20 Year Memorial AddressGeorgeW.BushAddress at the Flight 
	93 Memorial Ceremony Marking 20 Years Since the 9/11 Terrorist Attacksdelivered 11 
September 20201, Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, PennsylvaniaYour browser does not support the audio element.Thank you very much. Laura and I are honored to be with you. Madam Vice 
President, Vice President Cheney. Governor Wolf, Secretary Haaland, and 
distinguished guests:Twenty years ago, we all found -- in different ways, in different places, but 
all at the same moment -- that our lives would be changed forever. The world was 
loud with carnage and sirens, and then quiet with missing voices that would 
never be heard again. These lives remain precious to our country, and infinitely 
precious to many of you. Today we remember your loss, we share your sorrow, and 
we honor the men and women you have loved so long and so well.For those too young to recall that clear September day, it is hard to describe 
the mix of feelings we experienced.There was horror at the scale -- there was horror at the scale of destruction, 
and awe at the bravery and kindness that rose to meet it.There was shock at the audacity -- audacity of evil and gratitude for the 
heroism and decency that opposed it. In the sacrifice of the first responders, 
in the mutual aid of strangers, in the solidarity of grief and grace, the 
actions of an enemy revealed the spirit of a people. And we were proud of our 
wounded nation.In these memories, the passengers and crew of Flight 93 must always have an 
honored place. Here the intended targets became the instruments of rescue. And 
many who are now alive owe a vast, unconscious debt to the defiance displayed in 
the skies above this field.It would be a mistake to idealize the experience of those terrible events. All 
that many people could initially see was the brute randomness of death. All that 
many could feel was unearned suffering. All that many could hear was God's 
terrible silence. There are many who still struggle with a lonely pain that cuts 
deep within.In those fateful hours, we learned other lessons as well. We saw that Americans 
were vulnerable, but not fragile -- that they possess a core of strength that 
survives the worst that life can bring. We learned that bravery is more common 
than we imagined, emerging with sudden splendor in the face of death. We vividly 
felt how every hour with our loved ones was a temporary and holy gift. And we 
found that even the longest days end.Many of us have tried to make spiritual sense of these events. There is no 
simple explanation for the mix of providence and human will that sets the 
direction of our lives. But comfort can come from a different sort of knowledge. 
After wandering long and lost in the dark, many have found they were actually 
walking, step by step, toward grace.As a nation, our adjustments have been profound. Many Americans struggled to 
understand why an enemy would hate us with such zeal. The security measures 
incorporated into our lives are both sources of comfort and reminders of our 
vulnerability. And we have seen growing evidence that the dangers to our country 
can come not only across borders, but from violence that gathers within. There 
is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent 
extremists at home. But in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for 
human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children 
of the same foul spirit.And it is our continuing duty to confront them.After 9/11, millions of brave Americans stepped forward and volunteered to serve 
in the Armed Forces. The military measures taken over the last 20 years to 
pursue dangers at their source have led to debate. But one thing is certain: We 
owe an assurance to all who have fought our nation's most recent battles. Let me 
speak directly to veterans and people in uniform: The cause you pursued at the 
call of duty is the noblest America has to offer. You have shielded your fellow 
citizens from danger. You have defended the beliefs of your country and advanced 
the rights of the downtrodden. You have been the face of hope and mercy in dark 
places. You have been a force for good in the world. Nothing that has followed 
-- nothing -- can tarnish your honor or diminish your accomplishments. To you, 
and to the honored dead, our country is forever grateful.In the weeks and months following the 9/11 attacks, I was proud to lead an 
amazing, resilient, united people. When it comes to the unity of America, those 
days seem distant from our own. A malign force seems at work in our common life 
that turns every disagreement into an argument, and every argument into a clash 
of cultures. So much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear, 
and resentment. That leaves us worried about our nation and our future together.I come without explanations or solutions. I can only tell you what I have seen.
On America's day of trial and grief, I saw millions of people instinctively grab 
for a neighbor's hand and rally to the cause of one another. That is the America 
I know.
At a time when religious bigotry might have flowed freely, I saw Americans 
reject prejudice and embrace people of Muslim faith. That is the nation I know.
At a time when nativism could have stirred hatred and violence against people 
perceived as outsiders, I saw Americans reaffirm their welcome to immigrants and 
refugees. That is the nation I know.At a time when some viewed the rising generation as individualistic and 
decadent, I saw young people embrace an ethic of service and rise to selfless 
action. That is the nation I know.This is not mere nostalgia; it is the truest version of ourselves. It is what we 
have been -- and what we can be again.Original Text Source: CNN.comPage Updated: 9/12/21U.S. Copyright Status:Text = Uncertain.Audio = Property ofAmericanRhetoric.com
